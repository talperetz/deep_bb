VWhat do you think about the deal with Iran?
p1
aVHas the Middle East entered a phase of accelerated speed and change?
p2
aVBefore the Palestinians went to the UN, Israel threatened harsh measures in response and now you announced new settlement building between Jerusalem and Maaleh Adumin. If further settlement construction is Israel\u2019s default option, it makes it very difficult to believe that you\u2019re really interested in a peace agreement.
p3
aVWith the swift and careful action in Gaza, it seemed that Israel had gained international credit and also the fact that it stopped before a ground invasion. Now it seems that you\u2019re losing the credit that you gained in Europe with the announced settlement building. The French and British have even threatened to recall their ambassadors.
p4
aVBut the very place where you announced settlement building is a place where construction will make it very difficult in the future to come to a peace agreement with the Palestinians. It\u2019s vital for a future Palestinian state.
p5
aVWere you surprised by the reaction of France and UK and Sweden?
p6
aVSo what you\u2019re basically saying is that the countries that voted for the associate membership status of the Palestinian state violated the Oslo Agreement?
p7
aVYour government also decided to hold back tax transfers to the PA and use them for outstanding electricity bills. Many of your security experts have frequently warned that stripping the PA of money could destabilize the situation in the West Bank and endanger the security cooperation Israel.
p8
aVSince the start of the Arab revolts Israel seems to be increasingly beleaguered and on the defense. Was the Gaza war an attempt to play on the offense again?
p9
aVIn Europe many people consider you to be a hardliner, so it took some people by surprise that you didn\u2019t order a ground attack in Gaza. Also many Israelis didn\u2019t like that because they wanted to finish off the extremists for good this time. What were the reasons you decided to hold back even after the Cabinet had agreed to the biggest mobilization since the Lebanon War?
p10
aVAn Israeli TV channel suggested that there were other factors also. They reported that the Egyptians had threatened to cancel the peace agreement if Israel invaded Gaza. Is that correct?
p11
aVIf we look at all the threats that Israel faces, why would anyone in the world want your job? It seems to be the toughest job in the world.
p12
aVYou and your brother have both been in the military. Your older brother died in action. You were wounded. Do you think this makes you hard or determined in a way that European politicians in this generation that you\u2019re dealing with, who were born after the Second World War, just can\u2019t understand? That you can\u2019t find a common language in some cases because it\u2019s just such a different experience?
p13
aVWhen the Arab revolutions began, Israel warned of the possible consequences. It seems now that the Islamist movements are the victors of this development, and it seems also that Israel\u2019s hands are increasingly tied, also politically, in the region. How do you navigate in this kind of environment?
p14
aVCan you feel that your maneuvering space is getting smaller?
p15
aVIsrael\u2019s well-being is not only threatened by external developments; it seems that the productive part of society in Israel itself is getting always smaller. You could call it a middle-class squeeze because they are the ones who have to pay the taxes and who go to the army. According to the OECD, the Israeli school system is also falling behind. What would a new Netanyahu government do to change that?
p16
aVI meet a lot of young Israelis moving to Berlin and of course if you go to New York, you have a lot of bright, young Israelis living there, working there, founding companies there. Do you fear that the stress you have here, this political situation pushes some of the brightest people out of the country to some places where they feel safer?
p17
aVAnd you need everyone committed to the state, so do you see a chance to get the ultra-orthodox to serve in the army?
p18
aVBut you can\u2019t force them.
p19
aVHow does that work?
p20
aVIs that what you plan on doing, implement further cuts in child allowances?
p21
aVYour Likud party significantly moved to the right in the vote for the party list. How does it feel for a man with your political and ideological history to find himself at the left fringes of your own party?
p22
aVLike you did?
p23
aVIn the latest Gaza offensive, the German government and Angela Merkel personally were very vocal in defending Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against rockets from Gaza, but on the other hand some Israelis have been disappointed that Germany didn\u2019t vote against the Palestinian move at the UN. Are you coming with mixed feelings to Berlin?
p24
aVYou lost your father this year. He was a renowned historian. Could you describe what his legacy means for you or what the most important political lesson is that he taught you?
p25
aVTwo days ago, at the rally at Rabin Square, David Grossman, who lost his son Uri in the second Lebanon War, stood and spoke in a speech directed at you, during which he said: \u201cWhen is the last time the Prime Minister expressed or made a move which is in his power to open a new horizon for Israelis, a better future?  When has he initiated a social or cultural or meritorious step rather than simply respond \u2013 respond recklessly to moves forced on him by others?\u201d  Is there truth in this?
p26
aVCurrently the Realignment is frozen and there is not alternative.  The coalition is one of the broadest that have been, but to where does it lead?  Where are we going?
p27
aVIt is not the goal, it is the tool.
p28
aVIn that same speech, Grossman said: \u201cIf an Arab president or leader approaches you and wants to meet or make peace, you do not have the moral right not to invite him immediately for a meeting.
p29
aVThere does not need to be anything from Syria or Lebanon?
p30
aVYou want to meet with him? Are you calling on him to meet?
p31
aVWithout preconditions, are you prepared to meet with Asad as well?
p32
aVI am not always certain that you have time to make these decisions, because since you became Prime Minister \u2013 the State Comptroller has begun investigating you on a scale which is unprecedented.  Is all this smoke with no fire?
p33
aVIf there is an organized campaign, there must be an organizer.
p34
aVIs this a political conspiracy?
p35
aVThe announcement stated that generally, the State Comptroller is exceeding his authority and ruining the institution of the State Comptroller.  I understand that you agree with this.
p36
aVDo you sometimes get angry at yourself?  Do you ask yourself, \u201cperhaps I was not sensitive enough, perhaps I was not cautious enough as a public figure?\u201d \u2013 political insensitivity.
p37
aVYou say malicious and organized.  Do you mean that it is not just Lindenstrauss alone, but something broader?
p38
aVIt was written in the papers that in the polls, the public views you as the most corrupt leader.
p39
aVThis morning, thousands of Haredim again violently protested the Gay Pride Parade and the Attorney General decided that the Parade will take place in Jerusalem.  What do you think about that?
p40
aVTo conclude, a question with a one word answer: did we, in your opinion, win or lose the war?
p41
aVGood afternoon.  Well, can I just say first of all what a pleasure it is for me to be here, to be invited to conduct what I hope will be an important interview with the Prime Minister at Sky News.  We are well aware that we even have paying customers in Israel, so we very much try to please that audience and those viewers.
p42
aVNow, usually when I talk to august personages such as prime ministers, we are very hurried for time, but on this occasion, we have time for a fairly decent conversation.  So, I thought we would move through a number of issues that concern this conference, of course, in a moment, the perhaps perennial problems of the Middle East, but also maybe begin with some topical questions.
p43
aVIf you do not mind, before I start with American politics, which naturally is very important \u2013 it is almost even more important than our internal politics because it helps sometimes \u2013 I want first to take this opportunity to express my deep regret over the events which took place yesterday morning in Beit Hanoun, with the unfortunate shooting of Israeli artillery on innocent Palestinians in Beit Hanoun, which resulted in the killing of 18 civilians, most of them are members of one family.  This is certainly not the policy of Israel, this is not the objective of the Government of Israel, and this is tragic and we are very sad about it, and we deeply regret it.
p44
aVI was going to move on to that.  But to get down to a very important matter, can I put it to you that whatever the intentions of the two sides may be, that this question of proportionality keeps on being raised in this issue that in practice Palestinian civilians or earlier in the year, Lebanese civilians appeared to be hit disproportionately in the view of many people, and that is something which is damaging Israel's standing in the world.
p45
aVMany people measure it in terms of the number of people killed, the number of military personnel killed versus the number of civilians killed, and that is why Israel is so often criticized internationally.
p46
aVBut in that case, a lot of women and a lot of children were killed.
p47
aVSo, unfortunately, it does happen here.  We try to avoid it. I never use it as an excuse.  This is not an excuse.  What I am trying to do is to explain to you that unfortunately, against our better intentions, it occasionally does happen.  And we regret each and every case.
p48
aVMilitary operations will continue as long as there will be Qassam shooting on innocent people.  What kind of military operations, depends.  But we are not going to stop it.
p49
aVNo, we will not shoot with artillery. We will take precautions in order to avoid unnecessary mistakes.  That is for sure.  But I want to be very sincere with you.  We try to avoid the unnecessary involvement of innocent civilians which are not part of terror.  But I cannot promise that it will not happen.
p50
aVYou could say you simply will not attack targets of that sort and in that way.
p51
aVBut what is more is that the Qassam shooting does not help either.  And they have to remember it.
p52
aVHow much harder can they be?  Let us be realistic.  You look at them and you really wonder.  Here is Gaza, take Gaza.
p53
aVThe problem is, you are not disengaged, though, are you, militarily?
p54
aVBut one cannot ignore the fact that in spite of this, in spite of the fact that they cannot claim that we occupy one centimeter of Gaza, they did not stop shooting Qassam rockets at us from day one.  What else do you need to do?  What else do you need to do in order to convince them that it is time for them to reconcile, to change their priorities, to get to the table and sit down and talk seriously, rather than shoot and shoot and shoot and call for more terror, and cause so many victims on the Palestinian side, and destroy every fabric of life at a time when they could flourish.  I mean, they can look at us \u2013 it is not from a big distance \u2013 and they can see how the economy of Israel is flourishing.  And can you imagine what they could have had they been more cooperative?
p55
aVMay I ask you something?  Since you mentioned that you came with Tony Blair, did you come with your wife?
p56
aVWith your wife?
p57
aVWould you tell us, the audience\u2026 I mean, you do not mind that I am asking you questions, rather than answering.
p58
aVTell us a story about your wedding.
p59
aVYes.  At 10 Downing.
p60
aVYes, what happened when you married.  Was there any demonstration outside.
p61
aVAlright.
p62
aVYou see, these British guys, they only know how to ask the questions.  They do not know how to answer.
p63
aVWhy?  Because of what?
p64
aVAnd also? \u2026Tony Blair is someone I admire greatly.  I like him very much, I have to say.  He is my kind of guy.  He is a good guy, he is a really good guy.  And he suffered a lot because of what was perceived in Great Britain as his great support for Israel.  Partly, it was expressed while he was found to be in the wedding of Adam Bolton and his wife, who used to work for Tony Blair.  That is the story.
p65
aVI did not want to embarrass you.
p66
aVLook, first of all, I can understand, simply and easily, why so many people were uncomfortable with this event.  I am very uncomfortable with this event.  I am very distressed.  This is the worst that could happen to them and to us.  And the reasons are less important, but not entirely unimportant.
p67
aVWhy has that not happened yet then?
p68
aVWhat can you offer him?
p69
aVI am ready.  I say it often.  I could not be more open.  I could not be more sincere about it.  I will not release one to the Hamas, because they will not be paid off for extremity, but to Abu Mazen, many \u2013 I am ready to release many.  I was, I am and I will.
p70
aVYou heard about the Realignment Plan, right?  That I spelled out before the elections.  For the first time, at least in the recent history of Israel, a candidate for Prime Minister who was quite safe at that time, comes here and says, 'I'm ready to pull out of almost 90% of the territories.'
p71
aVListen, we are not going to commit suicide here.  Let it be clear.  We are going to fight, and we have proved it.  We proved it in Lebanon.  We have no sense of humor when someone attacks us.  We take it very seriously.  But we are ready to compromise in a serious manner if they are up for some serious business.  But they are controlled by the terrorists.  And Khaled Mashal is the prophet of the Palestinians, not Abu Mazen.  That is why everything is stuck.
p72
aVYou know, there was one time that I did not [unclear].  You know, because you were in my garden, in my home, when he was having dinner with me, and then we went to the press to be interviewed, to answer to some questions.  So, this was the first time that I thought that maybe Israeli journalists are not the worst in the world.
p73
aVI am ready to take part in it, not in any patronizing manner that I am going to control the Palestinians, but if there will be an international effort, led by Great Britain, to help strengthen the civil administration of the Palestinians, in order to make it reasonable and effective and helpful, I am ready to be part of it, and join in with him.
p74
aVWhat about if Tony Blair goes back to Syria, talks to President Assad again. Nigel Sheinwald was there.  Would that be a good idea or a bad idea?
p75
aV[Unclear] said that unless Syria is engaged, there can be no settlement.
p76
aVI am not against having an agreement with Syria.  It is just that, you know, Bashar Assad cannot eat the cake and have it at the same time.  That is something that we cannot accept.  He cannot sponsor the Hizbullah, sponsor Kahled Mashal, finance and actively support the terrorist actions throughout the Middle East, cannot be the most devoted partner of Iran, which calls for the liquidation of the State of Israel, and at the same time, get the bonus of the appearance of moderation by having some contacts with Israel.  This does not go together.
p77
aVHe has got to change, a little bit.  He has got to show some signs of change, some kind of seriousness.
p78
aVIn exchange?  You would like me to already exchange with you what he may expect to exchange with me if he will change?
p79
aVLook, Israel has, I think, proved in the past that we are ready for serious business with Syria if they are ready.  Serious business.
p80
aVOkay, let us move on to President Bush.
p81
aVIs he a lame duck?  Is it a waste of time really going to see him at all?
p82
aVthank G-d Bush is the President of the United States of America.  That I can say as Prime Minister of Israel.
p83
aVYou know Bush, do you?
p84
aVI can say that from our perspective any pullout, whenever it will take place, will have to be very carefully planned, in order not to upset the very delicate balance of the moderate countries in the Middle East and that includes some Arab countries and emirates and so on.  And I think that this is a major consideration.  I think that America, regardless of whether it is a Republican America or a Democratic America, will be very cautious before it makes a move that can jeopardize the balance, the delicate balance in this part of the world which is so extremely important for the stability in much larger parts of the world.
p85
aVFirst of all, I think that we entertain the support of so many legislatures, both in the House and in the Senate, that we don't count their religion, so it's interesting; it certainly is a reflection of the vitality of the Jewish community in America, but as far as Israel is concerned, thank G-d we have many supporters in America, also some Jews.
p86
aVI don't think that you noticed that we have with us here the Governor of the Israeli Bank, Professor Fischer, sitting next the to the Minister of Finance, Mr. Hirchson, and the chairman of the Manufacturers Association, Mr. Brosh.
p87
aVI remember all my life, ever since I was aware of what economics is all about, and what business is all about, we always said, export, export, export.  We have here a guy who soon will be recognized, Stef Wertheimer.  I know him, I don't know how many years, 25 years. He once, you could look at him, you wouldn't believe, but he was a Member of Parliament.  He doesn't want to remember those four years, but he was.  The one sentence that I remember from him, whenever one would mention his name to me, Stef Wertheimer, is exports.  When I was first appointed Minister of Industry and Trad \u2013 now there is Mr. Yishai sitting here, he is the Minister of Industry and Trade, I was four years ago \u2013 the first thing he came to me and say, squeeze for exports, don't forget exports, exports is the name of the game.  We have a positive surplus, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable.
p88
aVWe have to continue to invest in the periphery, and we have to make a dramatic change in the priorities within the State of Israel to seriously cope with the social difficulties, particularly of the underprivileged in our country.  The gap is too wide; it has to be narrowed down.  It's not enough that we, through the consistent growth of our economy, we are raising the income per capita; we have to make genuine efforts so that this income will be divided in a more evenly manner than it was up until now.
p89
aVAbsolutely.
p90
aVNow I have to ask you, why is Mr. Lieberman then part of your Government?
p91
aVThat we would have done with or without Lieberman and we will do it with Lieberman.  And on top of it, since you asked about Lieberman, we need a stable government in Israel.  We are sick and tired of going to elections every two years.  We are going to change the government system in Israel and this is going to be one of my top priorities, and Lieberman is going to be very helpful in making these reforms possible and that's why I'm very happy that he's in the Government.
p92
aVYou had a lot of continuity and stability in the actual policies.  You had too many ministers, but now we have the best, so I'm not worried.
p93
aVWell, he was on the panel when this\u2026
p94
aVHe didn't complain about it.
p95
aVI think that we have to increase the allocations through the Chief Scientist for research and development and that includes also bio-technology.  I think that we, I myself for instance, last year allocated through the Chief Scientist to the Ben Gurion University major funds in order to establish the National Center for Bio-Technology which will be part of the academics of Ben Guiron University, and the industrial park which is going to be developed, Industrial Park for Bio-Technologies next door.  So we are making efforts.
p96
aVThere have been major problems with the brain chain, have been problems with higher education.  You set up a panel to deal with higher education.
p97
aVWhat have you got to do with Israel's universities?
p98
aVYes.
p99
aVYou set up a panel which suggests you have got of work to do.
p100
aVYou sound like a man who is sort of settling in for a long stint in office, yet you look at the opinion polls, a very negative one about trust relating to you yesterday. Do you think you're going to be able to survive?
p101
aVSo listen, Israeli politics is very volatile and very dynamic and one thing which I have learned over the years is that you have to be very careful and build up your strategy for a long time, and that is what I am doing.  And my plans is that we will go through the full term of four years and 8 months, so we have almost four years still ahead of us.  And then I promise you, Adam, that I will arrange for the Prime Minister's Conference to invite you again to interview me about the plans for the next four years.
p102
aVOn the day that we decided to respond to the provocation of Hizbullah, we outlined the three objectives for the war.  One was to implement fully Resolution 1559 of the United Nations which was adopted 2-3 years before but was never implemented; to deploy the Lebanese army in the south of Lebanon; and to remove the danger or the threat of the Hizbullah.  The 1701 which includes 1559 of the United Nations was adopted, implemented, Lebanese army is deployed in Lebanon and there is an international army on top of it.
p103
aVIn all of those occasions when they attacked Israel and shot rockets on our northern part of Israel, there was no deterrence. They kept fighting, they kept trying.  Now ask them if they will try again.  I will only remind you of what Nasrallah said, 'Had I known only 1% of what would happen, I would have never started.'  Now he knows.  Therefore my judgment is that as a result of this war, of this 'disproportionate reaction' of Israel, they will not start another such war against the State of Israel.  And therefore I think that the outcome of this war is very good.
p104
aVIran is a different. I don't think that the danger of Iran started on the twelfth of July.   Only those who were asleep for many years didn't notice that Iran was becoming an imminent danger, not just to Israel, to the whole Western civilization.  It is a danger.  Now we are a lot more conscious about this danger than we were before the twelfth of July because of the war in Lebanon.  Therefore in this respect also we are more conscious, we are more aware, we are going to address ourselves to this in a much more serous manner, and there is a greater chance that we will be ready to prevent it better than we could had the fighting in Lebanon not take place altogether.
p105
aVlook at your team, Newcastle United, is losing all the time.  So he says, I know you are a fan of Manchester United, so I tell you I don't mind that Roman Abramowitz spends so much money on Chelsey; he spends money but not on soccer in Israel, on something different.
p106
aVPardon?   No, my club, yes, I don't think that he's an oligarch. Not that he is one of my revered personalities, but he came to Israel at the age of 20, so he didn't make his money in what is considered to be the oligarch pattern of making money.  In this respect he is not an oligarch. But all the big soccer teams are owned by rich people, right?  And I'll tell you something, whether I like him or not, I am a great fan of Beitar Jerusalem, and I hope that they will win the championship in Israel and will go to play in Europe and will do well in Europe.
p107
aVWe are going to play against Great Britain.  First we are going to play against Croatia soon.  And I very much, I hope that Robinson will be the goal keeper in the game between Israel and Great Britain.
p108
aVMr. Prime Minister, the president described the meetings today as frank and productive. Were told you might be able to add the words "blunt" and "testy." Is that fair?
p109
aVIf that condition has been removed, I dont know it. It has been a precondition as far as the Palestinians were concerned to come to the table. You have preconditions. They have preconditions. One of them is that settlements stop.
p110
aVBut Mr. Prime Minister, are you saying unequivocally, you will not offer any kind of a freeze - limited, full, any kind of a freeze - on settlements as a precondition to talks?
p111
aVWould you take some kind of a freeze for eight months or 12 months, since I understand that was discussed today?
p112
aVA former Israeli prime minister, the great Abba Eban, used to say about the Palestinians, they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. If you take this position on settlements, arent you missing an opportunity?
p113
aVBut I come back to the point. You have preconditions, they have preconditions. By not making some move in the direction of their preconditions, arent you missing an opportunity or dont you run the risk of missing an opportunity?
p114
aVLet me put that picture right back up, OK.  The handshake between you and Mr. Abbas \u2013 does it mean anything? Does it show any sign of progress or is that a long overdue photo-op?
p115
aVBut where do we stand? The President, you\u2019re saying the right things.  President Obama is saying the right things.  He says it\u2019s the time to act.  There\u2019s a window of opportunity.  He\u2019s going to send Hillary Clinton and George Mitchell back to the Middle East and try and build on this progress, but the fact of the matter is, George Mitchell just returned from the Middle East and accomplished almost nothing.  He didn\u2019t get the Palestinians to agree to negotiate without pre-conditions, he didn\u2019t get you to agree to dropping your insistence there could be no freeze of settlements.  So where do we stand?  What progress can we build on?
p116
aVYou say that you\u2019re willing to talk to the Palestinians without pre-conditions, but by refusing to freeze settlements on the West Bank, they say that that\u2019s a hollow promise \u2013 that you know you have basically stopped peace talks before they can begin.   How do you respond to that?
p117
aVHow big a gesture?
p118
aVLet me ask you a blunt question.  Does President Obama possess right now the clout and the power to move this process forward?  Some have suggested that the weak economy in this country has weakened the President to the point where he has no clout.
p119
aVReal quickly, I want to end and I\u2019m sorry to cut short the time.  But on Iran \u2013 you said that Iran is weaker than people think.  You are convinced that they are attempting to build nuclear weapons, and you\u2019ve said tougher sanctions are a way to prevent that.  China and Russia have never been on board with those tougher sanctions.  The President tried yesterday to talk to the Chinese about that \u2013 it\u2019s unclear if he made any progress.  Absent China and Russia joining that move for tougher sanctions \u2013 if they continue to move down the road they\u2019re on and develop nuclear weapons, in your opinion, at what point do you go it alone?  At what point do you strike?
p120
aVMr. Prime Minister, it\u2019s good to have you in the studio. Good luck this week at the UN.
p121
aVi can guarantee you this, the days when the jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over!
p122
aVthe truth is that if israel were to put down its arms there would be no more israel.
p123
aVif the arabs were to put down their arms there would be no more war.
p124
aVif iran's work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that break-out time could still be shorter, a lot shorter.
p125
aVtrue, certain restrictions would be imposed on iran's nuclear program and iran's adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors.
p126
aVbut here's the problem.
p127
aVyou see, inspectors document violations; they don't stop them.
p128
aVinspectors knew when north korea broke to the bomb, but that didn't stop anything.
p129
aVnorth korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors.
p130
aVwithin a few years, it got the bomb.
p131
aVnow, we're warned that within five years north korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs.
p132
aVlike north korea, iran, too, has defied international inspectors.
p133
aVit's done that on at least three separate occasions; 2005, 2006, 2010. like north korea, iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras.
p134
aVwe are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the twin towers and pentagon, and the american struggle in iraq.
p135
aVthe events swung american public opinion in our favor.
p136
aVi think the israeli people understand now what i always say: that there cannot be a situation, under any agreement, in which we relinquish security control of the territory west of the river jordan... we will defend ourselves on every front, defensively and offensively.
p137
aVisrael has no better friend than america.
p138
aVand america has no better friend than israel.
p139
aVwe stand together to defend democracy.
p140
aVwe stand together to advance peace.
p141
aVwe stand together to fight terrorism.
p142
aVcongratulations america.
p143
aVcongratulations, mister president.
p144
aVyou got bin laden.
p145
aVi am certain that i speak on behalf of my entire nation when i say: today we are all \u2014 in grief, as in defiance.
p146
aVthe difference is that isis is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons and youtube, whereas iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs.
p147
aVwe must always remember.
p148
aVi'll say it one more time; the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant islam with nuclear weapons.
p149
aVto defeat isis and let iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war.
p150
aVwe can't let that happen.
p151
aVisrael without jerusalem is like a body without a heart.
p152
aVour heart will never be divided again \u000a\u000ai, the prime minister of israel, care more about palestinians than their own leaders do.
p153
aVisrael cares more about palestinians than their own leaders do.
p154
aVwe will bring a comprehensive plan to the government to assist you in every way.
p155
aVthere is no room for racism and discrimination in our society, none... we will turn racism into something contemptible and despicable.
p156
aVisrael has extended its hand in peace from the moment it was established... in israel our hope for peace never wanes.
p157
aVour scientists, doctors, and innovators apply their genius to improve the world of tomorrow.
p158
aVour artists, our writers, enrich the heritage of humanity.
p159
aVnow, i know that this is not exactly the image of israel that is often portrayed... \u000a\u000ayou don't need to do nation building in israel, we're already built.
p160
aVyou don't need to export democracy to israel, we've already got it.
p161
aVyou don't need to send american troops to israel, we defend ourselves... israel is not what is wrong about the middle east, israel is what is about the middle east... the tyranny in tehran brutalizes its own people.
p162
aVit supports attacks against american troops in afghanistan and iraq.
p163
aVit subjugates lebanon and gaza.
p164
aVit sponsors terror worldwide... a nuclear-armed iran would ignite a nuclear arms race in the middle east.
p165
aVit would give terrorists a nuclear umbrella.
p166
aVit would make the nightmare of nuclear terrorism a clear and present danger throughout the world.
p167
aVi want you to understand what this means.
p168
aVthey could put the bomb anywhere.
p169
aVthey could put it on a missile.
p170
aVit could be on a container ship in a port, or in a suitcase on a subway... now the threat to my country cannot be overstated.
p171
aVthose who dismiss it are sticking their heads in the sand.
p172
aVless than seven decades after six million jews were murdered, iran's leaders deny the holocaust of the jewish people, while calling for the annihilation of the jewish state.
p173
aVleaders who spew such venom, should be banned from every respectable forum on the planet.
p174
aVbut there is something that makes the outrage even greater: the lack of outrage.
p175
aVin much of the international community, the calls for our destruction are met with utter silence.
p176
aVit is even worse because there are many who rush to condemn israel for defending itself against iran's terror proxies... when we say never again, we never again!
p177
aVisrael always reserves the right to defend itself... in judea and samaria, the jewish people are not foreign occupiers.
p178
aVwe are not the british in india.
p179
aVwe are not the belgians in the congo.
p180
aVthis is the land of our forefathers, the land of israel, to which abraham brought the idea of one god, where david set out to confront goliath, and where isaiah saw a vision of eternal peace... no distortion of history can deny the four thousand year old bond, between the jewish people and the jewish land... peace cannot be imposed.
p181
aVit must be negotiated.
p182
aVbut it can only be negotiated with partners committed to peace.
p183
aVas dangerous as a nuclear-armed north korea is, it pales in comparison to the danger of a nuclear-armed iran.
p184
aVa nuclear-armed iran in the middle east wouldn't be another north korea.
p185
aVit would be another 50 north koreas.
p186
aVi came here tonight to talk about the agreement and security that are broad consensus within israeli society.
p187
aVthis is what guides our policy.
p188
aVthis policy must take into account the international situation.
p189
aVwe have to recognize international agreements but also principles important to the state of israel.
p190
aVi spoke tonight about the first principle - recognition.
p191
aVpalestinians must truly recognize israel as the state of the jewish people.
p192
aVthe second principle is demilitarization.
p193
aVany area in palestinian hands has to be demilitarization, with solid security measures.
p194
aVwithout this condition, there is a real fear that there will be an armed palestinian state which will become a terrorist base against israel, as happened in gaza.
p195
aVwe do not want missiles on petah tikva, or grads on the ben-gurion international airport.
p196
aVwe want peace.
p197
aVi know what america is.
p198
aVamerica is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.
p199
aVthey won't get in our way.
p200
aV\u2026 they asked me before the election if i'd honor [the oslo accords] \u2026 i said i would, but \u2026 i'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders.
p201
aVhow did we do it?
p202
aVnobody said what defined military zones were.
p203
aVdefined military zones are security zones; as far as i'm concerned, the entire jordan valley is a defined military zone.
p204
aVgo argue.
p205
aVthey say that a military confrontation with iran would undermine the efforts already underway, that it would be ineffective, and that it would provoke even more vindictive action by iran.
p206
aVi've heard these arguments before.
p207
aVin fact, i've read them before.
p208
aVin my desk, i have copies of an exchange of letters between the world jewish congress and the us war department.
p209
aVthe year was 1944. the world jewish congress implored the american government to bomb auschwitz.
p210
aVthe reply came five days later.
p211
aVi want to read it to you: \u201csuch an operation could be executed only by diverting considerable air support essential to the success of our forces elsewhere... and in any case would be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources\u201d... and here's the most remarkable sentence of all.
p212
aVand i quote: \u201csuch an effort might provoke even more vindictive action by the germans.\u201d think about that \u2013 \u201ceven more vindictive action\u201d \u2014 than the holocaust.
p213
aVthe root cause of terrorism lies not in grievances but in a disposition toward unbridled violence.
p214
aVthis can be traced to a world view which asserts that certain ideological and religious goals justify, indeed demand, the shedding of all moral inhibitions.
p215
aVthe people of iran are very talented people.
p216
aVthey're heirs to one of the world's great civilizations.
p217
aVbut in 1979, they were hijacked by religious zealots; religious zealots who imposed on them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship.
p218
aVthat year, the zealots drafted a constitution, a new one for iran.
p219
aVit directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect iran's borders, but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad.
p220
aVthe regime's founder, ayatollah khomeini, exhorted his followers to export the revolution throughout the world.
p221
aVi'm standing here in washington, d.c. and the difference is so stark.
p222
aVamerica's founding document promises life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
p223
aViran's founding document pledges death, tyranny, and the pursuit of jihad.
p224
aVand as states are collapsing across the middle east, iran is charging into the void to do just that.
p225
aVto say that doesn't practice terrorism is like saying never played shortstop for the .
p226
aVbut then the question came up of just who would define what defined military sites were.
p227
aVi received a letter \u2013 to my and to arafat, at the same time \u2013 which said that israel, and only israel, would be the one to define what those are, the location of those military sites and their size.
p228
aVnow, they did not want to give me that letter, so i did not give the hebron agreement.
p229
aVi stopped the government meeting, i said: \u201ci\u2019m not signing.\u201d only when the letter came, in the course of the meeting, to my and to arafat, only then did i sign the hebron agreement.
p230
aVor rather, ratify it, it had already been signed.
p231
aVwhy does this matter?
p232
aVbecause at that moment i actually stopped the oslo accord.
p233
aViran took dozens of americans hostage in tehran, murdered hundreds of american soldiers, marines, in beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of american service men and women in iraq and afghanistan.
p234
aVbeyond the middle east, iran attacks america and its allies through its global terror network.
p235
aVit blew up the jewish community center and the israeli embassy in buenos aires.
p236
aVit helped al-qaeda bomb u.s. embassies in africa.
p237
aVit even attempted to assassinate the saudi ambassador, right here in washington, d.c. in the middle east, iran now dominates four arab capitals, baghdad, damascus, beirut and sanaa.
p238
aVand if iran's aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow.
p239
aVso, at a time when many hope that iran will join the community of nations, iran is busy gobbling up the nations.
p240
aVwe must all stand together to stop iran's march of conquest, subjugation and terror.
p241
aVwe cannot accept the fact that jews wouldn't be entitled to live and buy anywhere in jerusalem.
p242
aVi can only imagine what would happen if someone suggested jews could not live in certain neighborhoods in new york, london, paris or rome.
p243
aVthere would certainly be a major international outcry.
p244
aVamos regev, the editor-[in-chif] of , is a personal friend and my conversations with him are not within the framework of my job.
p245
aVas hamas's charter makes clear, hamas's immediate goal is to destroy israel.
p246
aVbut hamas has a broader objective.
p247
aVthey also want a caliphate.
p248
aVhamas shares the global ambitions of its fellow militant islamists.
p249
aVthat\u2019s why its supporters wildly cheered in the streets of gaza as thousands of americans were murdered on 9/11.
p250
aVand that's why its leaders condemned the united states for killing osama bin laden, whom they praised as a holy warrior.
p251
aVhatred of the jews has changed form but it still remains.
p252
aVif not racial superiority, then religious superiority is the order of the day.
p253
aVthe world's indifference in light of this hatred has also remained.
p254
aVthe world has very quickly become accustomed to hearing declarations only 65 years after the holocaust, declarations of intent to annihilate millions of jews \u2013 and the world continues to act in the same manner.
p255
aVthe hesitancy of enlightened countries to act against extreme regimes which threaten us and threaten world peace \u2013 this too has not changed.
p256
aVthe only thing that has truly changed is our ability and our determination to act to defend ourselves and prevent another holocaust.
p257
aVthis truth is a source of heavy and constant responsibility \u2013 to ensure by any means necessary the future and security of the state of israel against those who seek our destruction.
p258
aVthis is the last will and testament of the six million, our brothers and sisters who perished in the holocaust and it is our duty \u2013 and we will carry it out.
p259
aVinnocent and impoverished palestinians were denied vital aid supplied from nations around the world, stole critical support for palestinian children so that they could kill our children\u2026i express my deepest sympathy with innocent palestinians and those well-meaning nations who generously donated money to help them.
p260
aVthe difference between us is that we're using missile defense to protect our civilians and they're using their civilians to protect their missiles.
p261
aVin our time the biblical prophecies are being realized.
p262
aVas the prophet amos said, they shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them.
p263
aVthey shall plant vineyards and drink their wine.
p264
aVthey shall till gardens and eat their fruit.
p265
aVand i will plant them upon their soil never to be uprooted again.
p266
aVladies and gentlemen, the people of israel have come home never to be uprooted again.
p267
aVwe'll attack anyone who tries to harm our citizens.
p268
aVin recent days we witness attempts to break this coexistence apart.
p269
aVtoday, for example, i have heard of an attempt to move a woman from her seat on a bus.
p270
aVi oppose this unequivocally.
p271
aVi believe we must not allow margins groups to break our common denominator and we must keep our public spaces open and safe for all of our citizens.
p272
aVwe must find the uniting and mediating ground rather than the things that divide and separate us.
p273
aVevery time an arab leader truly wanted peace, they got it.
p274
aVif the palestinians truly want peace, we will make peace.
p275
aVthe czech republic stood with the u.s., canada and a handful of other countries against the prevailing international current, but history has shown us time and again that what is right is not what is popular.
p276
aVhitler didn't want to exterminate the jews at the time.
p277
aVhe wanted to expel the jews.
p278
aVthe labeling of products of the jewish state by the european union brings back dark memories.
p279
aVeurope should be ashamed of itself.
p280
aVit took an immoral decision.
p281
aVof the hundreds of territorial conflicts around the world, it chose to single out israel and israel alone, while it's fighting with its back against the wall against the wave of terror.
p282
aVfortunately, president obama and most world leaders understand that the idea that iran's goal is not to develop nuclear weapons is ridiculous.
p283
aVyet incredibly, some are prepared to accept an idea only slightly less preposterous: that we should accept a world in which the ayatollahs have atomic bombs.
p284
aVsure, they say, iran is cruel, but it's not crazy.
p285
aVit's detestable but it's deterrable.
p286
aVresponsible leaders should not bet the security of their countries on the belief that the world's most dangerous regime won't use the world's most dangerous weapons.
p287
aVand i promise you that as prime minister, i will never gamble with the security of israel.
p288
aVfrom the beginning, the ayatollah regime has broken every international rule and flouted every norm.
p289
aVit has seized embassies, targeted diplomats and sent its own children through mine fields.
p290
aVit hangs gays and stones women.
p291
aVit supports assad's brutal slaughter of the syrian people.
p292
aViran is the world's foremost sponsor of terror.
p293
aVit sponsors hezbollah in lebanon, hamas in gaza and terrorists throughout the middle east, africa, and south america.
p294
aViran's proxies have dispatched hundreds of suicide bombers, planted thousands of roadside bombs, and fired over twenty thousand missiles at civilians.
p295
aVthrough terror from the skies and terror on the ground, iran is responsible for the murder of hundreds, if not thousands, of americans.
p296
aVin 1983, iran's proxy hezbollah blew up the marine barracks in lebanon, killing 240 american servicemen.
p297
aVin the last decade, its been responsible for murdering and maiming american soldiers in afghanistan and iraq.
p298
aVjust a few months ago, it tried to assassinate the saudi ambassador in a restaurant just a few blocks from here.
p299
aVthe assassins didn't care that several senators and members of congress would have been murdered in the process.
p300
aViran accuses the american government of orchestrating 9/11, and it denies the holocaust.
p301
aViran brazenly calls for israel's destruction, and they work for its destruction \u2013 each day, every day.
p302
aVthis is how iran behaves today, without nuclear weapons.
p303
aVthink of how they will behave tomorrow, with nuclear weapons.
p304
aViran will be even more reckless and far more dangerous.
p305
aVthe art of politics and the idea of cohering interests.
p306
aVit doesn't matter if justice is on your side.
p307
aVyou have to depict your position as just.
p308
aVif diplomacy has any chance to work, it must be coupled with a credible military threat.
p309
aVhistory has shown us time and again that what is right is not what is popular.
p310
aVwe are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attacks on the twin towers and the pentagon and the american struggle in iraq.
p311
aVthese events swung american public opinion in our favor\u000a\u000aif the arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence.
p312
aVif the jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more israel\u000a\u000athe world should be very clear about making sure that iran does not get nuclear weapons, period.
p313
aVi think placing preconditions before negotiations is the quickest way to undermine peace.
p314
aVthere's an abiding interest by the united states, by the american people, and by anybody with his eyes set in his head, to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons.
p315
aVisrael has always been pro-american.
p316
aVisrael will always be pro-american.
p317
aVpeace is purchased from strength.
p318
aVit's not purchased from weakness or unilateral retreats.
p319
aVif we accept the notion that terrorists will have immunity because as they fire on civilians they hide behind civilians, then this tactic will be legitimized and the terrorists will have their greatest victory.
p320
aVi don't think israel can accept an iranian terror base next to its major cities any more than the united states could accept an al qaeda base next to new york city.
p321
aVi will say that i think israel enjoys strong bipartisan support in the united states.
p322
aVit's really above and beyond american politics.
p323
aVisrael is so tiny.
p324
aVit's, you know, a little less than the length of manhattan, without the west bank, without judea and samaria.
p325
aVisrael has, enjoys bipartisan support - both democrats and republicans - and we extend bipartisan hospitality to both democrats and republicans.
p326
aVisrael produces more conceptual products than any other country.
p327
aVthe application of military force, or the prospect of such application, inhibits terrorist violence.
p328
aVpopulism is dangerous.
p329
aVthe greatest threat facing humanity is a radical islamist regime meeting up with nuclear weapons.
p330
aVi'm not consumed with political machinations.
p331
aVi'm not naturally manipulative.
p332
aVi've been right more than i've been wrong.
p333
aVmy level of intervention in the press, trying to control stories, is zero.
p334
aVsubzero.
p335
aVthe relationship between israel and the united states is a bond of - it's just a very powerful bond.
p336
aVit was, it is, and will be and will continue to be.
p337
aVi'm the prime minister who removed 400 checkpoints, barriers, road-blocks and so on to facilitate the growth of the palestinian economy.
p338
aVi say that to my colleagues, by the way, in the internal cabinet meetings, i say, 'look, i want to be very clear about what i want.'
p339
aVi just - i don't want a peace process, i want a peace result.
p340
aVyou know, i said in the u.n., i said to president abbas, 'look, we're in the same city, we're in the same building, for god's sake, the u.n. let's just sit down and begin to talk peace.'
p341
aVso i think we should stay focused on the real problem in the middle east.
p342
aVit's not israel.
p343
aVit's these dictatorships that are developing nuclear weapons with the specific goal of wiping israel away.
p344
aVthe obama presidency has two great missions: fixing the economy, and preventing iran from gaining nuclear weapons.
p345
aVi always lose the election in the polls, and i always win it on election day.
p346
aVi think that a strong israel is the only israel that will bring the arabs to the peace table.
p347
aVi'm a proud member of the rabble.
p348
aVi am certain that i speak on behalf of my entire nation when i say: september 11th we are all americans - in grief, as in defiance.
p349
aVpeace is something very dear.
p350
aVif you've been through wars and operations and battles, you want peace.
p351
aVthe state of israel can be proud of what we're doing.
p352
aVyou know, i'm just not going to get into american politics.
p353
aVas far as a nuclear weapons-free zone, you know, when the lion lies down with the lamb, and you don't need a new lamb every day to satisfy the lion, then we might have this kind of transformation in the middle east.
p354
aVthere is a fundamental situation in which the country has reached rock bottom, that a mother can't send her children out of the house in the morning.
p355
aVthe country has reached rock bottom and this needs to be changed.
p356
aVsome will criticize me no matter what i do.
p357
aVyou can only end a negotiation for peace if you begin it.
p358
aVour policy is very simple.
p359
aVthe jewish state was set up to defend jewish lives, and we always reserve the right to defend ourselves.
p360
aVyou don't have people chanting 'death to america' in israel.
p361
aVwhy are we talking about talking?
p362
aVwhy negotiating about negotiating?
p363
aVit's very simple.
p364
aVif you want to get to peace, put all your preconditions on the side, sit down opposite a table, not in a studio, by the way.
p365
aVyou can't end negotiations unless you begin them.
p366
aVand you can't begin them if you continually negotiate about the terms to begin negotiations.
p367
aVwe don't point a pistol at our own forehead.
p368
aVthat is not the way to conduct negotiations.
p369
aVwe want israel as a democratic and jewish state.
p370
aVso you have to maintain a jewish majority, and you want to do that by legal means, by democratic means.
p371
aVthere's no one in israel who appreciates more than me the importance of american support for israel.
p372
aVthe purpose of the jewish state is to secure the jewish future.
p373
aVthat is why israel must always have the ability to defend itself, against any threat.
p374
aVfirst of all, arafat is wrong.
p375
aVjerusalem is israel's capital, will never be divided, and will remain the capital of the state of israel, the capital of the jewish people, for ever and ever.
p376
aVi often hear them accuse israel of judaizing jerusalem.
p377
aVthat's like accusing america of americanizing washington, or the british of anglicizing london.
p378
aVyou know why we're called 'jews'?
p379
aVbecause we come from judea.
p380
aVi don't want to govern the palestinians.
p381
aVi don't want them as subjects of israel or as citizens of israel.
p382
aVi want them to have their own independent state but a demilitarized state.
p383
aVthe right combination is between a free economy and social policy that addresses the needs of society and creates equal opportunity.
p384
aVthose in the international community that refuse to put red lines before iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before israel.
p385
aVi can tell you one thing, iran is closer to developing nuclear weapons today than it was a week ago, or a month ago or a year ago.
p386
aVit's just moving on with its efforts.
p387
aVthe u.s. has a stronger military than israel, but, but don't short-change israel, either.
p388
aVdon't short-change them.
p389
aVthe iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would be infinitely more costly than any scenario you can imagine to stop it.
p390
aVi think that peace will require two states, a palestinian state that recognizes the jewish state.
p391
aVthe rules of engagement have become so rigid that governments often straightjacket themselves in the face of unambiguous aggression.
p392
aVwe're willing to make difficult and hard decisions and compromises to live in peace with our neighbours, but we're entitled to our own country where jews from around the world can come here, just as palestinians from around the world can come to the palestinian state.
p393
aVhezbollah-controlled lebanon now presides over the un security council.
p394
aVthis means, in effect, that a terror organization presides over the body entrusted with guaranteeing the world's security.
p395
aVyou couldn't make this thing up.
p396
aVbut so far, you know who's been violating the nuclear nonproliferation pact day and night?
p397
aVthose who signed it.
p398
aViran, iraq, libya and iran violates it while calling for israel's destruction and racing to develop atomic weapons to that end.
p399
aVcertainly the international community is putting a lot of pressure on iran and making clear that its nuclear program must stop.
p400
aVif it stops with the sanctions, the combinations of sanctions, diplomacy, other pressures, i, as the prime minister of israel, will be the happiest person in the world.
p401
aVnow, when we say we want peace, what we want is really for our palestinian neighbours to have a demilitarized state next to us that recognizes the jewish state.
p402
aVwe're willing to recognize their state, the palestinian state.
p403
aVbut we ask them to recognize the jewish state.
p404
aVi don't think you can rely on iran.
p405
aVi don't think you can rely on other radicals like the taliban.
p406
aVthey dispatched al qaida to bomb new york and washington.
p407
aVwhat were they thinking?
p408
aVwere they that stupid?
p409
aVthey weren't stupid.
p410
aVthere is an irrationality there, and there is madness in this method.
p411
aVand by the way, a piece of news, israel is the one country in which everyone is pro-american, opposition and coalition alike.
p412
aVand i represent the entire people of israel who say, 'thank you, america.'
p413
aVand we're friends of america, and we're the only reliable allies of america in the middle east.
p414
aVwell, this is an unfortunate part of the un institution.
p415
aVit's the - the theater of the absurd.
p416
aVit doesn't only cast israel as the villain; it often casts real villains in leading roles: gadhafi's libya chaired the un commission on human rights; saddam's iraq headed the un committee on disarmament.
p417
aVmy first name, benjamin, dates back a thousand years earlier to benjamin - binyamin - the son of jacob, who was also known as israel.
p418
aVjacob and his 12 sons roamed these same hills of judea and sumeria 4,000 years ago, and there's been a continuous jewish presence in the land ever since.
p419
aVthe palestinians want a state, but they have to give peace in return.
p420
aVwhat they're trying to do in the united nations is to get a state without giving israel peace or giving israel peace and security.
p421
aVand i think that's, that's wrong.
p422
aVthat should not succeed.
p423
aVthat should, that should fail.
p424
aVpresident abbas, you've dedicated your life to advancing the palestinian cause.
p425
aVmust this conflict continue for generations, or will we enable our children and our grandchildren to speak in years ahead of how we found a way to end it?
p426
aVthat's what we should aim for, and that's what i believe we can achieve.
p427
aVin my office in jerusalem, there's an ancient seal.
p428
aVit's a signet ring of a jewish official from the time of the bible.
p429

aVhis name was netanyahu.

aVboth peoples, both nations, deserve a nation-state of their own.

aVpalestinians, if they wish so, will go to the palestinian state; jews, if they so wish, can go to the jewish state.
p434
aVand we'll have to have security and demilitarization agreements between us.
p435
aVthe israeli government has proved over the past year its commitment to peace, both in words and deeds.
p436
aVby contrast, the palestinians are posing preconditions for renewing the diplomatic process in a way they have not done over the course of 16 years.
p437
aVmost of the approaches to peace between israel and the palestinians, have been directed at trying to resolve the most complex problems, like refugees and jerusalem, which is akin to building the pyramid from the top down.
p438
aVhappy birthday to my dear wife sara.
p439
aVthank you for all that you do for the people of israel, for our family, and for me\u000a\u000ain recent days, hamas terrorists have fired hundreds of rockets at israel's civilians.
p440
aVno other country lives under such a threat, and no country would accept such a threat.
p441
aVisrael will not tolerate the firing of rockets on our cities and towns.
p442
aVwe have therefore significantly expanded our operations against hamas and the other terrorist organizations in gaza.
p443
aVthis comes after our repeated efforts to restore calm were met with increased hamas rocket fire.
p444
aVisrael is not eager for war, but the security of our citizens is our primary consideration.
p445
aVisrael targets hamas terrorists and not innocent civilians.
p446
aVby contrast, hamas targets israeli civilians while hiding behind palestinian civilians.
p447
aVhamas, therefore, bears full responsibility for any harm that comes to israeli and palestinian civilians alike.
p448
aVwe are determined to give our citizens the safety and security they deserve\u000a\u000aisrael is not bound by this deal with iran because iran continues to seek our destruction.
p449
aVwe will always defend ourselves\u000a\u000athank you - for the 1.3 million facebook friends.
p450
aVwe'll be in touch\u000a\u000athis thursday i will speak to the un general assembly.
p451
aVthe world needs to know how the citizens of israel feel about the nuclear agreement with iran and what we expect from the international community in the wake of this agreement\u000a\u000atoday in jerusalem a palestinian terrorist brutally stabbed a policeman.
p452
aVon friday a palestinian terrorist shot dead an israeli citizen.
p453
aVnot only has the palestinian authority refused to condemn these acts of violence, it continues unabashedly with its campaign of incitement against israel and israel's civilians.
p454
aVofficial palestinian propagation of violence and hatred are par for the course.
p455
aVit must be unequivocally condemned by all those who seek to advance peace.
p456
aVpeace will only come from direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions.
p457
aVit will not come from un resolutions that are sought to be imposed from the outside\u000a\u000ameeting of prime minister benjamin netanyahu with french president franois hollande in paris.
p458
aVcanadian prime minister harper this evening at the israeli parliament: "through fire and water, canada will stand with you\u000a\u000athis was the scene in tehran last friday.
p459
aVdemonstrators burned american and israeli flags.
p460
aVcrowds yelled "death to america!
p461
aVdeath to israel!"
p462
aVand who was marching in the front?
p463
aViranian president hassan rouhani.
p464
aVmeanwhile, in vienna, world powers are conceding more and more to iran.
p465
aVthey are conceding even on issues that had been marked as red lines in the lausanne framework, which was a bad deal in its own right.
p466
aViran does not hide its intentions.
p467
aVit continues its murderous aggression, even against those with whom it is negotiating.
p468
aVperhaps there are some world powers who are prepared to accept an iran that calls for the destruction of israel.
p469
aVisrael will never accept this\u000a\u000ahow does the united nations react to iranian calls for the destruction of israel?
p470
aVsilence.
p471
aVshare this if you refuse to be silent\u000a\u000awe are in the third day of operation protective edge.
p472
aVwhile the campaign has gone as planned further stages yet await us.
p473
aVwe have struck hard at hamas and the terrorists and as long as the campaign continues we will strike at them harder.
p474
aVi would like to thank the idf, isa, and the security services for their professional, dedicated and precise actions, and express the appreciation of all israelis.
p475
aVthey are making every effort to avoid hitting civilians and innocents are hit it is because hamas is maliciously hiding behind palestinian civilians.
p476
aVas of now, the idf, isa and other security services have successfully foiled many attempted attacks against israeli citizens but a tough, complex and complicated campaign yet awaits us.
p477
aVtherefore, i call on all israelis to continue to show the strength that you have shown in these days and hours.
p478
aVthis civilian fortitude is a main component of our ability to continue operations until we finish the work of restoring quiet and security to israel's cities.
p479
aVthe most important thing for us, for all of us, is to guard the lives of all israelis and we are all working together to this end\u000a\u000athe alternative to this bad deal is not war.
p480
aVthe alternative is a better deal that would roll back iran's military nuclear program and tie the easing of restrictions on iran's nuclear program to changes in iran's behavior\u000a\u000ait's time for the world to condemn terrorism against israel in the same manner that it condemns terrorism in france and anywhere else in the world\u000a\u000athe state of israel bows its head on the passing of former prime minister ariel sharon.
p481
aVariel sharon played a central role in the struggle for the security of the state of israel over all its years.
p482
aVhe was, first and foremost, a courageous fighter and an outstanding general, and was among the idf's greatest commanders.
p483
aVfrom his youth, he served the people of israel on the battlefield.
p484
aVhe did so as a soldier in the war of independence, a commander in the sinai campaign and the six day war, and up to his decisive role in the battle over the suez canal that led to the turning point in the yom kippur war.
p485
aVhe established unit 101 and took the initiative in the war against terrorism, which became a central pillar of the state of israel.
p486
aVupon leaving the military, he continued to work on behalf of the people of israel both in his many government roles and as the 11th prime minister of the state of israel.
p487
aVhis memory will be enshrined forever in the heart of the nation\u000a\u000aisrael stands in solidarity with the united states following thursday's attack that claimed the lives of four marines.
p488
aVon behalf of the people and government of israel, i extend our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and wish a speedy and full recovery to the wounded\u000a\u000athis afternoon my wife sara and i had a lovely visit to mount vernon, the home of george washington.

aVi salute you\u000a\u000agovernment and people of israel stand with the united states of america in marking 14 years since the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
p491
aVas we remember those who perished, we remain committed to fighting the forces of militant islam that have caused so much death and destruction both before and since that terrible day.
p492
aVour commitment is matched only by our conviction that we will prevail\u000a\u000aon this day, on behalf of the jewish people,  :i say to all those who have sought and still seek to destroy us  you have failed and you will fail\u000a\u000ai am speaking now about the security situation in israel.
p493
aVi will address the lies that the palestinian authority continues to tell\u000a\u000athis is a black day for the un.
p494
aVinstead of highlighting the fact that hamas made hostages of gazas children when it fired at israel from preschools, and dug tunnels towards israeli preschools, the un has again chosen to reproach israel that held itself to the highest moral standards in combat, as was determined just this past week by a group of senior american and european generals.
p495
aVat the same time, hamas - terror organization - is awarded immunity by the un, even though it has been proven beyond any doubt that it committed war crimes by firing from hospitals, mosques and from within un facilities.
p496
aVit turns out there is no limit to hypocrisy\u000a\u000athe upcoming election offers an important contrast between left and right.
p497
aVwe must focus on the security of our great nation.

p501
aVi suggest that hamas take our policy into account\u000a\u000aahead of israel's upcoming 66th independence day next week, prime minister benjamin netanyahu, today, visited the staffs of the security services of the state of israel, including the mossad, the isa, the idf and the atomic energy commission.
p502
aVprime minister netanyahu thanked the men and women of the security services for their work and noted that israel can celebrate its independence thanks to the dedicated personnel in the security establishment who work day and night so that the state of israel can stand strong in the face of the threats around us\u000a\u000ai am now leaving on an important trip to the us where i will meet with president barack obama.
p503
aVwe will discuss the iranian issue and the diplomatic process.
p504
aVi will stand steadfast on the state of israel's vital interests, especially the security of israel's citizens.
p505
aVin recent years the state of israel has been under various pressures.
p506
aVwe have rejected them in the face of the unprecedented storm and unrest in the region and are maintaining stability and security.
p507
aVthis is what has been and what will be\u000a\u000aprime minister benjamin netanyahu made today the following remarks while touring the sports complex being built in jerusalem: "today, not far from here, in the palestinian authority, they are marking what they call nakba day.
p508
aVthey stand silent in order to commemorate the disaster of the establishment of israel, the state of the jewish people.
p509
aVthey educate their children, with endless propaganda, that the state of israel needs to disappear.
p510
aVwe have many responses to this.
p511
aVthe first response is that we are continuing to build up our state and our united capital, jerusalem.
p512
aVwe will also give another response to the nakba: we will pass the nationality law that makes it clear to the entire world that israel is the state of the jewish people\u000a\u000athe greatest danger to humanity would be to let extremists have nuclear weapons\u000a\u000aprime minister benjamin netanyahu sharply condemns abu mazen's condolence letter to the family of yehuda glick's would-be assassin.
p513
aV"when we are trying to calm the situation, abu mazen sends condolences over the death of one who tried to perpetrate a reprehensible murder.
p514
aVthe time has come for the international community to condemn him for such actions," the prime minister said\u000a\u000alive broadcast: watch my speech to the un general assembly\u000a\u000a39 years of longing.
p515
aVyoni, my beloved brother and eternal hero, i miss you every day\u000a\u000awe are constantly fighting isis, jabhat - al nusra and other terrorist organizations.
p516
aVyesterday an israeli civilian crossed our border in the golan heights into syria to join the ranks of the enemy.
p517
aVwe will act to nullify his citizenship.
p518
aVthat is what is done in any such case.
p519
aVwhoever joins the ranks of the enemy to fight against israel, will not be an israeli citizen\u000a\u000airan, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, is squeezing more and more concessions from world powers meeting in vienna.
p520
aVi have no doubt that iran will use some of the hundreds of billions of dollars that it will receive in sanctions relief in order to expand its global terror network.
p521
aVwhy should we expect otherwise?
p522
aViran's ultimate goal is not to become part of the community of nations, but to take over the world.
p523
aVagainst all odds:a great victory for the likud.
p524
aVa major victory for the people of israel\u000a\u000alast night i presented michael douglas with the 2015 genesis prize.
p525
aVmichael won the prize not only because of his professional achievements, but also because of his connection to jewish tradition, his love for the jewish people, and his passion for the jewish state.
p526
aVmichael is a true friend of israel.
p527
aVhe has used his public influence to take a clear stand against anti-semitism, and he has correctly described the bds movement as an "ugly cancer."
p528
aVindeed, rather than suppressing his jewish identity, michael has embraced it  and encouraged his family to do the same.
p529
aVi was moved by his son dylan's desire to celebrate his bar mitzvah in israel, and i look forward to welcoming the entire family again to jerusalem when his daughter carys celebrates her bat mitzvah here.
p530
aVmichael plans to direct his prize money to organizations that promote inclusiveness and diversity in judaism.
p531
aVi want to emphasize: as prime minister of israel, i'm committed to strengthening the unity of the jewish people, and i will continue to reject any attempt to divide the jewish people and to delegitimize any jewish community.
p532
aVeveryone is welcome in israel  reform, conservative, orthodox alike.
p533
aVeveryone.
p534
aVmichael, i applaud you for all of your accomplishments, and for the impact you will certainly have in the years ahead in fulfilling your role as a genesis laureate.
p535
aVi applaud you for coming to jerusalem, our capital for 3,000 years, where we are shaping our future while remembering our past.
p536
aVi applaud you  and i think this is the most important thing  for setting an example to jews everywhere to stand tall and stand proud.
p537
aVshabbat shalom.
p538
aVthe deal with iran was a dream deal for iran but a nightmare deal for the world.
p539
aVwhen you are willing to make an agreement at any cost, this is the result.
p540
aVfrom the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is an historic mistake for the world.
p541
aVfar-reaching concessions have been made in all areas that were supposed to prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability.
p542
aVin addition, iran will receive hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its expansion and aggression throughout the middle east and across the globe.
p543
aVone cannot prevent an agreement when the negotiators are willing to make more and more concessions to those who, even during the talks, keep chanting: 'death to america.'
p544
aVwe knew very well that the desire to sign an agreement was stronger than anything, and therefore we did not commit to preventing an agreement.
p545
aVwe did commit to preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and this commitment still stands\u000a\u000afunds that were intended to building kindergartens for gaza's children were instead used by hamas to build tunnels of terror to strike at israeli kindergartens\u000a\u000athe iranian weapons ship reached israel last night.
p546
aVthe operation to seize the ship had two goals: preventing the delivery of deadly weapons to terrorist organizations in the gaza strip, which would have directly endangered israel's citizens, and exposing the true face of iran, which was behind this weapons shipment.
p547
aViran completely denies its involvement; it is lying in the most brazen manner.
p548
aVwe will present evidence of this tomorrow and later.
p549
aVi call this to the attention of catherine ashton, who is now visiting tehran.
p550
aVi would like to ask her if she asked her iranian hosts about this shipment of weapons for terrorist organizations, and if not, why not.
p551
aVnobody has the right to ignore the true and murderous actions of the regime in tehran.
p552
aVi think that it would be proper for the international community to give its opinion regarding iran's true policy, not its propaganda\u000a\u000awe are changing our policy and declaring war against those who throw stones and firebombs.
p553
aVwe will give our soldiers and police officers the tools that they need in order to implement this new policy as soon as possible\u000a\u000ato the israeli police officers and security forces in the field: you have my full backing and the full backing of the people of israel to take decisive action in order to save lives and to protect yourselves.
p554
aVthank you all for watching over us.
p555
aVtake care of yourselves\u000a\u000aprime minister benjamin netanyahu convened a security consultation this afternoon at israel police headquarters in jerusalem.
p556
aVprime minister netanyahu was briefed on last night's vehicular terrorist attack in jerusalem and on the disturbances that have occurred in jerusalem in recent months.
p557
aVhe directed that sovereignty be asserted in all parts of the city via the stationing of additional forces throughout the city.
p558
aVprime minister netanyahu met with the jerusalem district police officer who shot the terrorist and asked to send his condolences to the family of three-month-old chaya zissel braun who was murdered in the attack: "on behalf of the entire nation, i send condolences to the family of this pure baby and my wishes for a quick and full recovery to those who were wounded."
p559
aVprime minister netanyahu added, "united jerusalem was - and will remain - israel's eternal capital.
p560
aVall attempts to attack its residents will be met with a very sharp reaction; we will restore quiet and security to jerusalem.
p561
aVto this end i have directed that reinforcements be brought in, including additional border police units, which are moving in today, as well as with lookouts, intelligence and enforcement measures.
p562
aVthese, along with other steps that i will not detail here, can and will restore quiet to the capital.
p563
aVi rely on the people sitting here.
p564
aVwe will support the israel police and give it whatever reinforcements and capabilities it needs to carry out this mission.
p565
aVwe have proven that with determination and patience we can achieve these goals in all parts of the state of israel.
p566
aVnot only is jerusalem under terrorist attack but other capitals and cities around the world are as well.
p567
aVbut the attacks in jerusalem are supported by palestinian authority chairman abu mazen, who both extols the murderers and embraces the organization that the terrorists belong to, hamas.
p568
aVand against these actions by the palestinian authority chairman, we find international weakness; they are not prepared to utter so much as a word of criticism against him.
p569
aVwe have no such weakness.
p570
aVwe will insist on our rights and on our obligation to defend our capital.
p571
aVwe will do strongly - and we will win."
p572
aVhow much light kaiya has brought into our home!
p573
aVif you are thinking of getting a canine, find an adult dog to rescue.
p574
aVyou won't regret it\u000a\u000athe bottom line of this very bad deal is exactly what iran's president rouhani said today: "the international community is removing the sanctions and iran is keeping its nuclear program."
p575
aVby not dismantling iran's nuclear program, in a decade this deal will give an unreformed, unrepentant and far richer terrorist regime the capacity to produce many nuclear bombs, in fact an entire nuclear arsenal with the means to deliver it.
p576
aVwhat a stunning historic mistake!
p577
aVdo you agree?
p578
aVshare my full statement.
p579
aVthe world needs to know\u000a\u000athis morning, 232 new immigrants arrived in israel from the united states on an el al charter flight organized by nefesh b'nefesh, in cooperation with the ministry of immigrant absorption and the jewish agency for israel.
p580
aVfrom this group, 59 young people will be joining the israel defense forces.
p581
aVto the soon-to-be soldiers: i salute you.
p582
aVto all the new citizens: welcome home.
p583
aVthe people of israel are so proud of you.
p584
aVwe have only one land  the land of israel.
p585
aVwe are guarding it and thwarting terror attacks, as we did yesterday in jenin.
p586
aVwe are responding to all fire on our territory, in ways seen and in ways unseen.
p587
aVmy policy against terrorism is clear: zero restraint, zero let-up, zero tolerance for terrorism\u000a\u000awatch and share:  prime minister benjamin netanyahu was interviewed today by cbs's face the nation and fox news sunday, regarding operation "protective edge\u000a\u000athe best way to guarantee peace is to be strong.
p588
aVand thats what the people of israel expect me to do  to stand strong against criticism, against pressure, stand strong to secure the future of the one and only jewish state\u000a\u000atwo things that happened today: 1. iranian supreme leader ali khamenei tweeted a video calling for the destruction of israel, a un member state.
p589
aV2. the un security council voted to lift sanctions on iran.
p590
aVthe hypocrisy knows no bounds.
p591
aVthe best way to fight this hypocrisy is to tell the truth in a strong and unified manner\u000a\u000ai said to the jewish federations' general assembly: the only way to fight lies is by telling the truth.
p592
aVwe have nothing to be ashamed of.
p593
aVstand proud and tell the truth about israel\u000a\u000athere are elements in europe that rush to condemn the construction of a flat in jerusalem but do not rush to condemn  or offer only weak condemnations of  the murder of jews here or in europe itself and, even worse, welcome unity with a terrorist element such as hamas, which calls for the destruction of the state of israel.
p594
aVwe oppose such hypocrisy, we protest against it, we will continue to always state the truth, we will continue to fight terrorism and we will continue to build up our state\u000a\u000ashare this: these are the employees of an israeli pharmaceutical company in ashdod.
p595
aVthis company manufactures medicine that is transferred to the gaza strip, from which rockets are fired at themladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000athree thousand years ago, king david reigned over the jewish state in our eternal capital, jerusalem.
p596
aVi say that to all those who proclaim that the jewish state has no roots in our region and that it will soon disappear.
p597
aVthroughout our history, the jewish people have overcome all the tyrants who have sought our destruction.
p598
aVit\u2019s their ideologies that have been discarded by history.
p599
aVthe people of israel live on.
p600
aVwe say in hebrew am yisrael chai, and the jewish state will live forever.
p601
aVthe jewish people have lived in the land of israel for thousands of years.
p602
aVeven after most of our people were exiled from it, jews continued to live in the land of israel throughout the ages.
p603
aVthe masses of our people never gave up the dreamed of returning to our ancient homeland.
p604
aVdefying the laws of history, we did just that.
p605
aVwe ingathered the exiles, restored our independence and rebuilt our national life.
p606
aVthe jewish people have come home.
p607
aVwe will never be uprooted again.
p608
aVyesterday was yom kippur, the holiest day of the jewish year.
p609
aVevery year, for over three millennia, we have come together on this day of reflection and atonement.
p610
aVwe take stock of our past.
p611
aVwe pray for our future.
p612
aVwe remember the sorrows of our persecution; we remember the great travails of our dispersion; we mourn the extermination of a third of our people, six million, in the holocaust.
p613
aVbut at the end of yom kippur, we celebrate.
p614
aVwe celebrate the rebirth of israel.
p615
aVwe celebrate the heroism of our young men and women who have defended our people with the indomitable courage of joshua, david, and the maccabees of old.
p616
aVwe celebrate the marvel of the flourishing modern jewish state.
p617
aVin israel, we walk the same paths tread by our patriarchs abraham, isaac and jacob.
p618
aVbut we blaze new trails in science, technology, medicine, agriculture.
p619
aVin israel, the past and the future find common ground.
p620
aVunfortunately, that is not the case in many other countries.
p621
aVfor today, a great battle is being waged between the modern and the medieval.
p622
aVthe forces of modernity seek a bright future in which the rights of all are protected, in which an ever-expanding digital library is available in the palm of every child, in which every life is sacred.
p623
aVthe forces of medievalism seek a world in which women and minorities are subjugated, in which knowledge is suppressed, in which not life but death is glorified.
p624
aVthese forces clash around the globe, but nowhere more starkly than in the middle east.
p625
aVisrael stands proudly with the forces of modernity.
p626
aVwe protect the rights of all our citizens:  men and women, jews and arabs, muslims and christians \u2013 all are equal before the law.
p627
aVisrael is also making the world a better place: our scientists win nobel prizes.
p628
aVour know-how is in every cell-phone and computer that you\u2019re using.
p629
aVwe prevent hunger by irrigating arid lands in africa and asia.
p630
aVrecently, i was deeply moved when i visited technion, one of our technological institutes in haifa, and i saw a man paralyzed from the waist down climb up a flight of stairs, quite easily, with the aid of an israeli invention.
p631
aVand israel\u2019s exceptional creativity is matched by our people\u2019s remarkable compassion.
p632
aVwhen disaster strikes anywhere in the world \u2013 in haiti, japan, india, turkey indonesia and elsewhere \u2013 israeli doctors are among the first on the scene, performing life-saving surgeries.
p633
aVin the past year, i lost both my father and my father-in-law.
p634
aVin the same hospital wards where they were treated, israeli doctors were treating palestinian arabs.
p635
aVin fact, every year, thousands of arabs from the palestinian territories and arabs from throughout the middle east come to israel to be treated in israeli hospitals by israeli doctors.
p636
aVi know you\u2019re not going to hear that from speakers around this podium, but that\u2019s the truth.
p637
aVit\u2019s important that you are aware of this truth.
p638
aVit\u2019s because israel cherishes life, that israel cherishes peace and seeks peace.
p639
aVwe seek to preserve our historic ties and our historic peace treaties with egypt and jordan.
p640
aVwe seek to forge a durable peace with the palestinians.
p641
aVpresident abbas just spoke here.
p642
aVi say to him and i say to you:\u000a\u000awe won\u2019t solve our conflict with libelous speeches at the un.
p643
aVthat\u2019s not the way to solve it.
p644
aVwe won\u2019t solve our conflict with unilateral declarations of statehood.
p645
aVwe have to sit together, negotiate together, and reach a mutual compromise, in which a demilitarized palestinian state recognizes the one and only jewish state.
p646
aVisrael wants to see a middle east of progress and peace.
p647
aVwe want to see the three great religions that sprang forth from our region \u2013 judaism, christianity and islam \u2013 coexist in peace and in mutual respect.
p648
aVyet the medieval forces of radical islam, whom you just saw storming the american embassies throughout the middle east, they oppose this.
p649
aVthey seek supremacy over all muslims.
p650
aVthey are bent on world conquest.
p651
aVthey want to destroy israel, europe, america.
p652
aVthey want to extinguish freedom.
p653
aVthey want to end the modern world.
p654
aVmilitant islam has many branches \u2013 from the rulers of iran with their revolutionary guards to al qaeda terrorists to the radical cells lurking in every part of the globe.
p655
aVbut despite their differences, they are all rooted in the same bitter soil of intolerance.
p656
aVthat intolerance is directed first at their fellow muslims, and then to christians, jews, buddhists, hindus, secular people, anyone who doesn\u2019t submit to their unforgiving creed.
p657
aVthey want to drag humanity back to an age of unquestioning dogma and unrelenting conflict.
p658
aVi am sure of one thing.
p659
aVultimately they will fail.
p660
aVultimately, light will penetrate the darkness.
p661
aVwe\u2019ve seen that happen before.
p662
aVsome five hundred years ago, the printing press helped pry a cloistered europe out of a dark age.
p663
aVeventually, ignorance gave way to enlightenment.
p664
aVso too, a cloistered middle east will eventually yield to the irresistible power of freedom and technology.
p665
aVwhen this happens, our region will be guided not by fanaticism and conspiracy, but by reason and curiosity.
p666
aVi think the relevant question is this: it\u2019s not whether this fanaticism will be defeated.
p667
aVit\u2019s how many lives will be lost before it\u2019s defeated.
p668
aVwe\u2019ve seen that happen before too.
p669
aVsome 70 years ago, the world saw another fanatic ideology bent on world conquest.
p670
aVit went down in flames.
p671
aVbut not before it took millions of people with it.
p672
aVthose who opposed that fanaticism waited too long to act.
p673
aVin the end they triumphed, but at an horrific cost.
p674
aVmy friends, we cannot let that happen again.
p675
aVat stake is not merely the future of my own country.
p676
aVat stake is the future of the world.
p677
aVnothing could imperil our common future more than the arming of iran with nuclear weapons.
p678
aVto understand what the world would be like with a nuclear-armed iran, just imagine the world with a nuclear-armed al-qaeda.
p679
aVit makes no difference whether these lethal weapons are in the hands of the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorist regime or the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorist organization.
p680
aVthey\u2019re both fired by the same hatred; they\u2019re both driven by the same lust for violence.
p681
aVjust look at what the iranian regime has done up till now, without nuclear weapons.
p682
aVin 2009, they brutally put down mass protests for democracy in their own country.
p683
aVtoday, their henchmen are participating in the slaughter of tens of thousands of syrian civilians, including thousands of children, directly participating in this murder.
p684
aVthey abetted the killing of american soldiers in iraq and continue to do so in afghanistan.
p685
aVbefore that, iranian proxies killed hundreds of american troops in beirut and in saudi arabia.
p686
aVthey\u2019ve turned lebanon and gaza into terror strongholds, embedding nearly 100,000 missiles and rockets in civilian areas.
p687
aVthousands of these rockets and missiles have already been fired at israeli communities by their terrorist proxies.
p688
aVin the last year, they\u2019ve spread their international terror networks to two dozen countries across five continents \u2013 from india and thailand to kenya and bulgaria.
p689
aVthey\u2019ve even plotted to blow up a restaurant a few blocks from the white house in order to kill a diplomat.
p690
aVand of course, iran\u2019s rulers repeatedly deny the holocaust and call for israel\u2019s destruction almost on a daily basis, as they did again this week from the united nations.
p691
aVso i ask you, given this record of iranian aggression without nuclear weapons, just imagine iranian aggression with nuclear weapons.
p692
aVimagine their long range missiles tipped with nuclear warheads, their terror networks armed with atomic bombs.
p693
aVwho among you would feel safe in the middle east?
p694
aVwho would be safe in europe?
p695
aVwho would be safe in america?
p696
aVwho would be safe anywhere?
p697
aVthere are those who believe that a nuclear-armed iran can be deterred like the soviet union.
p698
aVthat\u2019s a very dangerous assumption.
p699
aVmilitant jihadists behave very differently from secular marxists.
p700
aVthere were no soviet suicide bombers.
p701
aVyet iran produces hordes of them.
p702
aVdeterrence worked with the soviets, because every time the soviets faced a choice between their ideology and their survival, they chose their survival.
p703
aVbut deterrence may not work with the iranians once they get nuclear weapons.
p704
aVthere\u2019s a great scholar of the middle east, prof. bernard lewis, who put it best.
p705
aVhe said that for the ayatollahs of iran, mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent, it\u2019s an inducement.
p706
aViran\u2019s apocalyptic leaders believe that a medieval holy man will reappear in the wake of a devastating holy war, thereby ensuring that their brand of radical islam will rule the earth.
p707
aVthat\u2019s not just what they believe.
p708
aVthat\u2019s what is actually guiding their policies and their actions.
p709
aVjust listen to ayatollah rafsanjani who said, i quote:  \u201cthe use of even one nuclear bomb inside israel will destroy everything, however it would only harm the islamic world.\u201d\u000a\u000arafsanjani said: \u201cit is not irrational to contemplate such an eventuality.\u201d\u000a\u000anot irrational\u2026\u000a\u000aand that\u2019s coming from one of the so-called moderates of iran.
p710
aVshockingly, some people have begun to peddle the absurd notion that a nuclear-armed iran would actually stabilize the middle east.
p711
aVyeah, right\u2026\u000a\u000athat\u2019s like saying a nuclear-armed al-qaeda would usher in an era of universal peace.
p712
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000ai\u2019ve been speaking about the need to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons for over 15 years.
p713
aVi spoke about it in my first term in office as prime minister, and then i spoke about it when i left office.
p714
aVi spoke about it when it was fashionable, and i spoke about it when it wasn\u2019t fashionable.
p715
aVi speak about it now because the hour is getting late, very late.
p716
aVi speak about it now because the iranian nuclear calendar doesn\u2019t take time out for anyone or for anything.
p717
aVi speak about it now because when it comes to the survival of my country, it\u2019s not only my right to speak; it\u2019s my duty to speak.
p718
aVand i believe that this is the duty of every responsible leader who wants to preserve world peace.
p719
aVfor nearly a decade, the international community has tried to stop the iranian nuclear program with diplomacy.
p720
aVthat hasn\u2019t worked.
p721
aViran uses diplomatic negotiations as a means to buy time to advance its nuclear program.
p722
aVfor over seven years, the international community has tried sanctions with iran.
p723
aVunder the leadership of president obama, the international community has passed some of the strongest sanctions to date.
p724
aVi want to thank the governments represented here that have joined in this effort.
p725
aVit\u2019s had an effect.
p726
aVoil exports have been curbed and the iranian economy has been hit hard.
p727
aVit\u2019s had an effect on the economy, but we must face the truth.
p728
aVsanctions have not stopped iran\u2019s nuclear program either.
p729
aVaccording to the international atomic energy agency, during the last year alone, iran has doubled the number of centrifuges in its underground nuclear facility in qom.
p730
aVat this late hour, there is only one way to peacefully prevent iran from getting atomic bombs.
p731
aVthat\u2019s by placing a clear red line on iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.
p732
aVred lines don\u2019t lead to war; red lines prevent war.
p733
aVlook at nato\u2019s charter: it made clear that an attack on one member country would be considered an attack on all.
p734
aVnato\u2019s red line helped keep the peace in europe for nearly half a century.
p735
aVpresident kennedy set a red line during the cuban missile crisis.
p736
aVthat red line also prevented war and helped preserve the peace for decades.
p737
aVin fact, it\u2019s the failure to place red lines that has often invited aggression.
p738
aVif the western powers had drawn clear red lines during the 1930s, i believe they would have stopped nazi aggression and world war ii might have been avoided.
p739
aVin 1990, if saddam hussein had been clearly told that his conquest of kuwait would cross a red line, the first gulf war might have been avoided.
p740
aVclear red lines have also worked with iran.
p741
aVearlier this year, iran threatened to close the straits of hormouz.
p742
aVthe united states drew a clear red line and iran backed off.
p743
aVred lines could be drawn in different parts of iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.
p744
aVbut to be credible, a red line must be drawn first and foremost in one vital part of their program: on iran\u2019s efforts to enrich uranium.
p745
aVnow let me explain why:\u000a\u000abasically, any bomb consists of explosive material and a mechanism to ignite it.
p746
aVthe simplest example is gunpowder and a fuse.
p747
aVthat is, you light the fuse and set off the gunpowder.
p748
aVin the case of iran\u2019s plans to build a nuclear weapon, the gunpowder is enriched uranium.
p749
aVthe fuse is a nuclear detonator.
p750
aVfor iran, amassing enough enriched uranium is far more difficult than producing the nuclear fuse.
p751
aVfor a country like iran, it takes many, many years to enrich uranium for a bomb.
p752
aVthat requires thousands of centrifuges spinning in tandem in very big industrial plants.
p753
aVthose iranian plants are visible and they\u2019re still vulnerable.
p754
aVin contrast, iran could produce the nuclear detonator \u2013 the fuse \u2013 in a lot less time, maybe under a year, maybe only a few months.
p755
aVthe detonator can be made in a small workshop the size of a classroom.
p756
aVit may be very difficult to find and target that workshop, especially in iran.
p757
aVthat\u2019s a country that\u2019s bigger than france, germany, italy and britain combined.
p758
aVthe same is true for the small facility in which they could assemble a warhead or a nuclear device that could be placed in a container ship.
p759
aVchances are you won\u2019t find that facility either.
p760
aVso in fact the only way that you can credibly prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon, is to prevent iran from amassing enough enriched uranium for a bomb.
p761
aVso, how much enriched uranium do you need for a bomb?
p762
aVand how close is iran to getting it?
p763
aVlet me show you.
p764
aVi brought a diagram for you.
p765
aVhere\u2019s the diagram.
p766
aVthis is a bomb; this is a fuse.
p767
aVin the case of iran\u2019s nuclear plans to build a bomb, this bomb has to be filled with enough enriched uranium.
p768
aVand iran has to go through three stages.
p769
aVthe first stage: they have to enrich enough of low enriched uranium.
p770
aVthe second stage: they have to enrich enough medium enriched uranium.
p771
aVand the third stage and final stage: they have to enrich enough high enriched uranium for the first bomb.
p772
aVwhere\u2019s iran?
p773
aViran\u2019s completed the first stage.
p774
aVit took them many years, but they completed it and they\u2019re 70% of the way there.
p775
aVnow they are well into the second stage.
p776
aVby next spring, at most by next summer at current enrichment rates, they will have finished the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage.
p777
aVfrom there, it\u2019s only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.
p778
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000awhat i told you now is not based on secret information.
p779
aVit\u2019s not based on military intelligence.
p780
aVit\u2019s based on public reports by the international atomic energy agency.
p781
aVanybody can read them.
p782
aVthey\u2019re online.
p783
aVso if these are the facts, and they are, where should the red line be drawn?
p784
aVthe red line should be drawn right here\u2026\u000a\u000abefore iran completes the second stage of nuclear enrichment necessary to make a bomb.
p785
aVbefore iran gets to a point where it\u2019s a few months away or a few weeks away from amassing enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon.
p786
aVeach day, that point is getting closer.
p787
aVthat\u2019s why i speak today with such a sense of urgency.
p788
aVand that\u2019s why everyone should have a sense of urgency.
p789
aVsome who claim that even if iran completes the enrichment process, even if it crosses that red line that i just drew, our intelligence agencies will know when and where iran will make the fuse, assemble the bomb, and prepare the warhead.
p790
aVlook, no one appreciats our intelligence agencies more than the prime minister of israel.
p791
aVall these leading intelligence agencies are superb, including ours.
p792
aVthey\u2019ve foiled many attacks.
p793
aVthey\u2019ve saved many lives.
p794
aVbut they are not foolproof.
p795
aVfor over two years, our intelligence agencies didn\u2019t know that iran was building a huge nuclear enrichment plant under a mountain.
p796
aVdo we want to risk the security of the world on the assumption that we would find in time a small workshop in a country half the size of europe?
p797
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000athe relevant question is not when iran will get the bomb.
p798
aVthe relevant question is at what stage can we no longer stop iran from getting the bomb.
p799
aVthe red line must be drawn on iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program because these enrichment facilities are the only nuclear installations that we can definitely see and credibly target.
p800
aVi believe that faced with a clear red line, iran will back down.
p801
aVthis will give more time for sanctions and diplomacy to convince iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program altogether.
p802
aVtwo days ago, from this podium, president obama reiterated that the threat of a nuclear-armed iran cannot be contained.
p803
aVi very much appreciate the president\u2019s position as does everyone in my country.
p804
aVwe share the goal of stopping iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.
p805
aVthis goal unites the people of israel.
p806
aVit unites americans, democrats and republicans alike and it is shared by important leaders throughout the world.
p807
aVwhat i have said today will help ensure that this common goal is achieved.
p808
aVisrael is in discussions with the united states over this issue, and i am confident that we can chart a path forward together.
p809
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000athe clash between modernity and medievalism need not be a clash between progress and tradition.
p810
aVthe traditions of the jewish people go back thousands of years.
p811
aVthey are the source of our collective values and the foundation of our national strength.
p812
aVat the same time, the jewish people have always looked towards the future.
p813
aVthroughout history, we have been at the forefront of efforts to expand liberty, promote equality, and advance human rights.
p814
aVwe champion these principles not despite of our traditions but because of them.
p815
aVwe heed the words of the jewish prophets isaiah, amos, and jeremiah to treat all with dignity and compassion, to pursue justice and cherish life and to pray and strive for peace.
p816
aVthese are the timeless values of my people and these are the jewish people\u2019s greatest gift to mankind.
p817
aVlet us commit ourselves today to defend these values so that we can defend our freedom and protect our common civilization.
p818
aVthank you.
p819
aVi feel deeply honored and privileged to stand here before you today representing the citizens of the state of israel.
p820
aVwe are an ancient people.
p821
aVwe date back nearly 4,000 years to abraham, isaac and jacob.
p822
aVwe have journeyed through time.
p823
aVwe\u2019ve overcome the greatest of adversities.
p824
aVand we re-established our sovereign state in our ancestral homeland, the land of israel.
p825
aVnow, the jewish people\u2019s odyssey through time has taught us two things: never give up hope, always remain vigilant.
p826
aVhope charts the future.
p827
aVvigilance protects it.
p828
aVtoday our hope for the future is challenged by a nuclear-armed iran that seeks our destruction.
p829
aVbut i want you to know, that wasn\u2019t always the case.
p830
aVsome 2,500 years ago the great persian king cyrus ended the babylonian exile of the jewish people.
p831
aVhe issued a famous edict in which he proclaimed the right of the jews to return to the land of israel and rebuild the jewish temple in jerusalem.
p832
aVthat\u2019s a persian decree.
p833
aVand thus began an historic friendship between the jews and the persians that lasted until modern times.
p834
aVbut in 1979 a radical regime in tehran tried to stamp out that friendship.
p835
aVas it was busy crushing the iranian people\u2019s hope for democracy, it always led wild chants of \u201cdeath of the jews.\u201d\u000a\u000anow, since that time, presidents of iran have come and gone.
p836
aVsome presidents were considered moderates, other hard-liners.
p837
aVbut they\u2019ve all served that same unforgiving creed, that same unforgiving regime, that creed that is espoused and enforced by the real power in iran, the dictator known as the supreme leader, first ayatollah khomeini and now ayatollah khamenei.
p838
aVpresident rouhani, like the presidents who came before him, is a loyal servant of the regime.
p839
aVhe was one of only six candidates the regime permitted to run for office.
p840
aVsee, nearly 700 other candidates were rejected.
p841
aVso what made him acceptable?
p842
aVwell, rouhani headed iran\u2019s supreme national security council from 1989 through 2003. during that time iran\u2019s henchmen gunned down opposition leaders in a berlin restaurant.
p843
aVthey murdered 85 people at the jewish community center in buenos aires.
p844
aVthey killed 19 american soldiers by blowing up the khobar towers in saudi arabia.
p845
aVare we to believe that rouhani, the national security adviser of iran at the time, knew nothing about these attacks?
p846
aVof course he did, just as 30 years ago iran\u2019s security chiefs knew about the bombings in beirut that killed 241 american marines and 58 french paratroopers.
p847
aVrouhani was also iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator between 2003 and 2005. he masterminded the \u2014 the strategy which enabled iran to advance its nuclear weapons program behind a smoke screen of diplomatic engagement and very soothing rhetoric.
p848
aVnow i know: rouhani doesn\u2019t sound like ahmadinejad.
p849
aVbut when it comes to iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program, the only difference between them is this: ahmadinejad was a wolf in wolf\u2019s clothing.
p850
aVrouhani is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, a wolf who thinks he can pull the eyes \u2014 the wool over the eyes of the international community.
p851
aVwell, like everyone else, i wish we could believe rouhani\u2019s words, but we must focus on iran\u2019s actions.
p852
aVand it\u2019s the brazen contrast, this extraordinary contradiction, between rouhani\u2019s words and iran\u2019s actions that is so startling.
p853
aVrouhani stood at this very podium last week and praised iranian democracy \u2014 iranian democracies.
p854
aVbut the regime that he represents executes political dissidents by the hundreds and jails them by the thousands.
p855
aVrouhani spoke of, quote, \u201cthe human tragedy in syria.\u201d yet, iran directly participates in assad\u2019s murder and massacre of tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children in syria.
p856
aVand that regime is propping up a syrian regime that just used chemical weapons against its own people.
p857
aVrouhani condemned the, quote, \u201cviolent scourge of terrorism.\u201d yet, in the last three years alone, iran has ordered, planned or perpetrated terrorist attacks in 25 cities in five continents.
p858
aVrouhani denounces, quote, \u201cattempts to change the regional balance through proxies.\u201d yet, iran is actively destabilizing lebanon, yemen, bahrain and many other middle eastern countries.
p859
aVrouhani promises, quote, \u201cconstructive engagement with other countries.\u201d yet, two years ago, iranian agents tried to assassinate saudi arabia\u2019s ambassador in washington, d.c. and just three weeks ago, an iranian agent was arrested trying to collect information for possible attacks against the american embassy in tel aviv.
p860
aVsome constructive engagement.
p861
aVi wish i could be moved by rouhani\u2019s invitation to join his wave \u2014 a world against violence and extremism.
p862
aVyet, the only waves iran has generated in the last 30 years are waves of violence and terrorism that it has unleashed in the region and across the world.
p863
aVladies and gentlemen, i wish i could believe rouhani, but i don\u2019t because facts are stubborn things, and the facts are that iran\u2019s savage record flatly contradicts rouhani\u2019s soothing rhetoric.
p864
aVlast friday rouhani assured us that in pursuit of its nuclear program, iran \u2014 this is a quote \u2014 iran has never chosen deceit and secrecy, never chosen deceit and secrecy.
p865
aVwell, in 2002 iran was caught red-handed secretly building an underground centrifuge facility in natanz.
p866
aVand then in 2009 iran was again caught red-handed secretly building a huge underground nuclear facility for uranium enrichment in a mountain near qom.
p867
aVrouhani tells us not to worry.
p868
aVhe assures us that all of this is not intended for nuclear weapons.
p869
aVany of you believe that?
p870
aVif you believe that, here\u2019s a few questions you might want to ask.
p871
aVwhy would a country that claims to only want peaceful nuclear energy, why would such a country build hidden underground enrichment facilities?
p872
aVwhy would a country with vast natural energy reserves invest billions in developing nuclear energy?
p873
aVwhy would a country intent on merely civilian nuclear programs continue to defy multiple security council resolutions and incur the tremendous cost of crippling sanctions on its economy?
p874
aVand why would a country with a peaceful nuclear program develop intercontinental ballistic missiles, whose sole purpose is to deliver nuclear warheads?
p875
aVyou don\u2019t build icbms to carry tnt thousands of miles away; you build them for one purpose, to carry nuclear warheads.
p876
aVand iran is building now icbms that the united states says could reach this city in three or four years.
p877
aVwhy would they do all this?
p878
aVthe answer is simple.
p879
aViran is not building a peaceful nuclear program; iran is developing nuclear weapons.
p880
aVlast year alone, iran enriched three tons of uranium to 3 1/2 percent, doubled it stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium and added thousands of new centrifuges, including advanced centrifuges.
p881
aVit also continued work on the heavy water reactor in iraq; that\u2019s in order to have another route to the bomb, a plutonium path.
p882
aVand since rouhani\u2019s election \u2014 and i stress this \u2014 this vast and feverish effort has continued unabated.
p883
aVladies and gentlemen, underground nuclear facilities, heavy water reactors, advanced centrifuges, icbms.
p884
aVsee, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s hard to find evidence that iran has a nuclear program, a nuclear weapons program; it\u2019s hard to find evidence that iran doesn\u2019t have a nuclear weapons program.
p885
aVlast year when i spoke here at the un i drew a red line.
p886
aVnow, iran has been very careful not to cross that line but iran is positioning itself to race across that line in the future at a time of its choosing.
p887
aViran wants to be in a position to rush forward to build nuclear bombs before the international community can detect it and much less prevent it.
p888
aVyet iran faces one big problem, and that problem can be summed up in one word: sanctions.
p889
aVi have argued for many years, including on this podium, that the only way to peacefully prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons is to combine tough sanctions with a credible military threat.
p890
aVand that policy today is bearing fruit.
p891
aVthanks to the efforts of many countries, many represented here, and under the leadership of the united states, tough sanctions have taken a big bite off the iranian economy.
p892
aVoil revenues have fallen.
p893
aVthe currency has plummeted.
p894
aVbanks are hard-pressed to transfer money.
p895
aVso as a result, the regime is under intense pressure from the iranian people to get the sanctions relieved or removed.
p896
aVthat\u2019s why rouhani got elected in the first place.
p897
aVthat\u2019s why he launched his charm offensive.
p898
aVhe definitely wants to get the sanctions lifted; i guarantee you that.
p899
aVbut he doesn\u2019t want to give up iranians\u2019 nuclear \u2014 iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program in return.
p900
aVnow here\u2019s a strategy to achieve this.
p901
aVfirst, smile a lot.
p902
aVsmiling never hurts.
p903
aVsecond, pay lip service to peace, democracy and tolerance.
p904
aVthird, offer meaningless concessions in exchange for lifting sanctions.
p905
aVand fourth, and the most important, ensure that iran retains sufficient nuclear material and sufficient nuclear infrastructure to race to the bomb at a time it chooses to do so.
p906
aVyou know why rouhani thinks he can get away with this?
p907
aVi mean, this is a ruse.
p908
aVit\u2019s a ploy.
p909
aVwhy does rouhani think he \u2014 thinks he can get away with it?
p910
aVbecause \u2014 because he\u2019s gotten away with it before, because his strategy of talking a lot and doing little has worked for him in the past.
p911
aVhe even brags about this.
p912
aVhere\u2019s what he said in his 2011 book about his time as iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, and i quote: \u201cwhile we were talking to the europeans in tehran, we were installing equipment in isfahan.\u201d\u000a\u000anow, for those of you who don\u2019t know, the isfahan facility is an indispensable part of iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.
p913
aVthat\u2019s where uranium ore called yellowcake is converted into an enrichable form.
p914
aVrouhani boasted, and i quote, \u201cby creating a calm environment \u2014 a calm environment \u2014 we were able to complete the work in isfahan.\u201d he fooled the world once.
p915
aVnow he thinks he can fool it again.
p916
aVyou see, rouhani thinks he can have his yellowcake and eat it too.
p917
aVand he has another reason to believe that he can get away with this.
p918
aVand that reason is called north korea.
p919
aVlike iran, north korea also said its nuclear program was for peaceful purposes.
p920
aVlike iran, north korea also offered meaningless concessions and empty promises in return for sanctions relief.
p921
aVin 2005 north korea agreed to a deal that was celebrated the world over by many well-meaning people.
p922
aVhere\u2019s what the new york times editorial had to say about it, quote: \u201cfor years now, foreign policy insiders have pointed to north korea as the ultimate nightmare, a closed, hostile and paranoid dictatorship with an aggressive nuclear weapons program.
p923
aVvery few could envision a successful outcome, and yet north korea agreed in principle this week to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, return to the npt, abide by the treaty\u2019s safeguards and admit international inspectors.\u201d and finally, \u201cdiplomacy, it seems, does work after all.\u201d\u000a\u000aladies and gentlemen, a year later, north korea exploded its first nuclear weapons device.
p924
aVyet, as dangerous as a nuclear-armed north korea is, it pales in comparison to the danger of a nuclear-armed iran.
p925
aVa nuclear-armed iran would have a choke hold on the world\u2019s main energy supplies.
p926
aVit would trigger nuclear proliferation throughout the middle east, turning the most unstable part of the planet into a nuclear tinderbox.
p927
aVand for the first time in history, it would make the specter of nuclear terrorism a clear and present danger.
p928
aVa nuclear-armed iran in the middle east wouldn\u2019t be another north korea.
p929
aVit would be another 50 north koreas.
p930
aVnow, i know that some in the international community think i\u2019m exaggerating this threat.
p931
aVsure, they know that iran\u2019s regime leads these chants, \u201cdeath to america, death to israel,\u201d that it pledges to wipe israel off the map.
p932
aVbut they think that this wild rhetoric is just bluster for domestic consumption.
p933
aVhave these people learned nothing from history?
p934
aVthe last century has taught us that when a radical regime with global ambitions gets awesome power, sooner or later its appetite for aggression knows no bounds.
p935
aVthat\u2019s the central lesson of the 20th century.
p936
aVand we cannot forget it.
p937
aVthe world may have forgotten this lesson.
p938
aVthe jewish people have not.
p939
aViran\u2019s fanaticism is not bluster.
p940
aVit\u2019s real.
p941
aVthe fanatic regime must never be allowed to arm itself with nuclear weapons.
p942
aVi know that the world is weary of war.
p943
aVwe in israel, we know all too well the cost of war.
p944
aVbut history has taught us that to prevent war tomorrow, we must be firm today.
p945
aVand this raises the question, can diplomacy stop this threat?
p946
aVwell, the only diplomatic solution that would work is one that fully dismantles iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program and prevents it from having one in the future.
p947
aVpresident obama rightly said that iran\u2019s conciliatory words must be matched by transparent, verifiable and meaningful action.
p948
aVand to be meaningful, a diplomatic solution would require iran to do four things.
p949
aVfirst, cease all uranium enrichment.
p950
aVthis is called for by several security council resolutions.
p951
aVsecond, remove from iran\u2019s territory the stockpiles of enriched uranium.
p952
aVthird, dismantle the infrastructure for nuclear breakout capability, including the underground facility at qom and the advanced centrifuges in natanz.
p953
aVand, four, stop all work at the heavy water reactor in iraq aimed at the production of plutonium.
p954
aVthese steps would put an end to iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program and eliminate its breakout capability.
p955
aVthere are those who would readily agreed to leave iran with a residual capability to enrich uranium.
p956
aVi advise them to pay close attention to what rouhani said in his speech to iran\u2019s supreme cultural revolution \u2014 supreme cultural revolutionary council.
p957
aVthis was published in 2005. i quote.
p958
aVthis is what he said:\u000a\u000a\u201ca county that could enrich uranium to about 3.5 percent will also have the capability to enrich it to about 90 percent.
p959
aVhaving fuel cycle capability virtually means that a country that possesses this capability is able to produce nuclear weapons.\u201d precisely.
p960
aVthis is why iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program must be fully and verifiably dismantled.
p961
aVand this is why the pressure on iran must continue.
p962
aVso here is what the international community must do: first, keep up the sanctions.
p963
aVif iran advances its nuclear weapons program during negotiations, strengthen the sanctions.
p964
aVsecond, don\u2019t agree to a partial deal.
p965
aVa partial deal would lift international sanctions that have taken years to put in place in exchange for cosmetic concessions that will take only weeks for iran to reverse.
p966
aVthird, lift the sanctions only when iran fully dismantles its nuclear weapons program.
p967
aVmy friends, the international community has iran on the ropes.
p968
aVif you want to knock out iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program peacefully, don\u2019t let up the pressure.
p969
aVkeep it up.
p970
aVwe all want to give diplomacy with iran a chance to succeed, but when it comes to iran, the greater the pressure, the greater the chance.
p971
aVthree decades ago, president ronald reagan famously advised, \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d when it comes to iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program, here\u2019s my advice: distrust, dismantle and verify.
p972
aVladies and gentlemen, israel will never acquiesce to nuclear arms in the hands of a rogue regime that repeatedly promises to wipe us off the map.
p973
aVagainst such a threat, israel will have no choice but to defend itself.
p974
aVi want there to be no confusion on this point.
p975
aVisrael will not allow iran to get nuclear weapons.
p976
aVif israel is forced to stand alone, israel will stand alone.
p977
aVyet, in standing alone, israel will know that we will be defending many, many others.
p978
aVthe dangers of a nuclear-armed iran and the emergence of other threats in our region have led many of our arab neighbors to recognize, finally recognize, that israel is not their enemy.
p979
aVand this affords us the opportunity to overcome the historic animosities and build new relationships, new friendships, new hopes.
p980
aVisrael welcomes engagement with the wider arab world.
p981
aVwe hope that our common interests and common challenges will help us forge a more peaceful future.
p982
aVand israel\u2019s \u2014 continues to seek an historic compromise with our palestinian neighbors, one that ends our conflict once and for all.
p983
aVwe want peace based on security and mutual recognition, in which a demilitarized palestinian state recognizes the jewish state of israel.
p984
aVi remain committed to achieving an historic reconciliation and building a better future for israelis and palestinians alike.
p985
aVnow, i have no illusions about how difficult this will be to achieve.
p986
aVtwenty years ago, the peace process between israel and the palestinians began.
p987
aVsix israeli prime ministers, myself included, have not succeeded at achieving peace with the palestinians.
p988
aVmy predecessors were prepared to make painful concessions.
p989
aVso am i. but so far the palestinian leaders haven\u2019t been prepared to offer the painful concessions they must make in order to end the conflict.
p990
aVfor peace to be achieved, the palestinians must finally recognize the jewish state, and israel\u2019s security needs must be met.
p991
aVi am prepared to make an historic compromise for genuine and enduring peace, but i will never compromise on the security of my people and of my country, the one and only jewish state.
p992
aVladies and gentlemen, one cold day in the late 19th century, my grandfather nathan and his younger brother judah were standing in a railway station in the heart of europe.
p993
aVthey were seen by a group of anti-semitic hoodlums who ran towards them waving clubs, screaming \u201cdeath to the jews.\u201d\u000a\u000amy grandfather shouted to his younger brother to flee and save himself, and he then stood alone against the raging mob to slow it down.
p994
aVthey beat him senseless, they left him for dead, and before he passed out, covered in his own blood, he said to himself \u201cwhat a disgrace, what a disgrace.
p995
aVthe descendants of the macabees lie in the mud powerless to defend themselves.\u201d\u000a\u000ahe promised himself then that if he lived, he would take his family to the jewish homeland and help build a future for the jewish people.
p996
aVi stand here today as israel\u2019s prime minister because my grandfather kept that promise.
p997
aVand so many other israelis have a similar story, a parent or a grandparent who fled every conceivable oppression and came to israel to start a new life in our ancient homeland.
p998
aVtogether we\u2019ve transformed a bludgeoned jewish people, left for dead, into a vibrant, thriving nation, a defending itself with the courage of modern maccabees, developing limitless possibilities for the future.
p999
aVin our time the biblical prophecies are being realized.
p1000
aVas the prophet amos said, they shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them.
p1001
aVthey shall plant vineyards and drink their wine.
p1002
aVthey shall till gardens and eat their fruit.
p1003
aVand i will plant them upon their soil never to be uprooted again.
p1004
aVladies and gentlemen, the people of israel have come home never to be uprooted again.
p1005
aVthirty-one years ago, as israel\u2019s ambassador to the united nations, i stood at this podium for the first time.
p1006
aVi spoke that day against a resolution sponsored by iran to expel israel from the united nations.
p1007
aVthen as now, the un was obsessively hostile towards israel, the one true democracy in the middle east.
p1008
aVthen as now, some sought to deny the one and only jewish state a place among the nations.
p1009
aVi ended that first speech by saying: gentlemen, check your fanaticism at the door.
p1010
aVmore than three decades later, as the prime minister of israel, i am again privileged to speak from this podium.
p1011
aVand for me, that privilege has always come with a moral responsibility to speak the truth.
p1012
aVso after three days of listening to world leaders praise the nuclear deal with iran, i begin my speech today by saying: ladies and gentlemen, check your enthusiasm at the door.
p1013
aVyou see, this deal doesn\u2019t make peace more likely.
p1014
aVby fueling iran\u2019s aggressions with billions of dollars in sanctions relief, it makes war more likely.
p1015
aVjust look at what iran has done in the last six months alone, since the framework agreement was announced in lausanne.
p1016
aViran boosted its supply of devastating weapons to syria.
p1017
aViran sent more soldiers of its revolutionary guard into syria.
p1018
aViran sent thousands of afghani and pakistani shi\u2019ite fighters to syria.
p1019
aViran did all this to prop up assad\u2019s brutal regime.
p1020
aViran also shipped tons of weapons and ammunitions to the houthi rebels in yemen, including another shipment just two days ago.
p1021
aViran threatened to topple jordan.
p1022
aViran\u2019s proxy hezbollah smuggled into lebanon sa-22 missiles to down our planes, and yakhont cruise missiles to sink our ships.
p1023
aViran supplied hezbollah with precision-guided surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones so it can accurately hit any target in israel.
p1024
aViran aided hamas and islamic jihad in building armed drones in gaza.
p1025
aViran also made clear its plans to open two new terror fronts against israel, promising to arm palestinians in the west bank and sending its revolutionary guard generals to the golan heights, from which its operatives recently fired rockets on northern israel.
p1026
aVisrael will continue to respond forcefully to any attacks against it from syria.
p1027
aVisrael will continue to act to prevent the transfer of strategic weapons to hezbollah from and through syrian territory.
p1028
aVevery few weeks, iran and hezbollah set up new terror cells in cities throughout the world.
p1029
aVthree such cells were recently uncovered in kuwait, jordan and cyprus.
p1030
aVin may, security forces in cyprus raided a hezbollah agent\u2019s apartment in the city of larnaca.
p1031
aVthere they found five tons of ammonium nitrate, that\u2019s roughly the same amount of ammonium nitrate that was used to blow up the federal building in oklahoma city.
p1032
aVand that\u2019s just in one apartment, in one city, in one country.
p1033
aVbut iran is setting up dozens of terror cells like this around the world, ladies and gentlemen, they\u2019re setting up those terror cells in this hemisphere too.
p1034
aVi repeat: iran\u2019s been doing all of this, everything that i\u2019ve just described, just in the last six months, when it was trying to convince the world to remove the sanctions.
p1035
aVnow just imagine what iran will do after those sanctions are lifted.
p1036
aVunleashed and un-muzzled, iran will go on the prowl, devouring more and more prey.
p1037
aVin the wake of the nuclear deal, iran is spending billions of dollars on weapons and satellites.
p1038
aVyou think iran is doing that to advance peace?
p1039
aVyou think hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief and fat contracts will turn this rapacious tiger into a kitten?
p1040
aVif you do, you should think again.
p1041
aVin 2013 president rouhani began his so-called charm offensive here at the un.
p1042
aVtwo years later, iran is executing more political prisoners, escalating its regional aggression, and rapidly expanding its global terror network.
p1043
aVyou know they say, actions speak louder than words.
p1044
aVbut in iran\u2019s case, the words speak as loud as the actions.
p1045
aVjust listen to the deputy commander of iran\u2019s revolutionary guard quds force.
p1046
aVhere\u2019s what he said in february:\u000a\u000a\u201cthe islamic revolution is not limited by geographic borders\u2026.\u201d he boasted that afghanistan, iraq, lebanon, syria, palestine and yemen are among the countries being \u201cconquered by the islamic republic of iran.\u201d\u000a\u000aconquered.
p1047
aVand for those of you who believe that the deal in vienna will bring a change in iran\u2019s policy, just listen to what iran\u2019s supreme leader ayatollah khamenei said five days after the nuclear deal was reached: \u201cour policies towards the arrogant government of the united states will not change.\u201d the united states, he vowed, will continue to be iran\u2019s enemy.
p1048
aVwhile giving the mullahs more money is likely to fuel more repression inside iran, it will definitely fuel more aggression outside iran.
p1049
aVas the leader of a country defending itself every day against iran\u2019s growing aggression, i wish i could take comfort in the claim that this deal blocks iran\u2019s path to nuclear weapons.
p1050
aVbut i can\u2019t, because it doesn\u2019t.
p1051
aVthis deal does place several constraints on iran\u2019s nuclear program.
p1052
aVand rightly so, because the international community recognizes that iran is so dangerous.
p1053
aVbut you see here\u2019s the catch:\u000a\u000aunder this deal, if iran doesn\u2019t change its behavior, in fact, if it becomes even more dangerous in the years to come, the most important constraints will still be automatically lifted by year 10 and by year 15. that would place a militant islamic terror regime weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs.
p1054
aVthat just doesn\u2019t make any sense.
p1055
aVi\u2019ve said that if iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.
p1056
aVbut this deal, this deal will treat iran like a normal country even if it remains a dark theocracy that conquers its neighbors, sponsors terrorism worldwide and chants \u201cdeath to israel\u201d, \u201cdeath to america.\u201d\u000a\u000adoes anyone seriously believe that flooding a radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression?
p1057
aVdo any of you really believe that a theocratic iran with sharper claws and sharper fangs will be more likely to change its stripes?
p1058
aVso here\u2019s a general rule that i\u2019ve learned and you must have learned in your life time \u2013 when bad behavior is rewarded, it only gets worse.
p1059
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000ai have long said that the greatest danger facing our world is the coupling of militant islam with nuclear weapons.
p1060
aVand i\u2019m gravely concerned that the nuclear deal with iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of that unholy union.
p1061
aVi know that some well-intentioned people sincerely believe that this deal is the best way to block iran\u2019s path to the bomb.
p1062
aVbut one of history\u2019s most important yet least learned lessons is this: the best intentions don\u2019t prevent the worst outcomes.
p1063
aVthe vast majority of israelis believe that this nuclear deal with iran is a very bad deal.
p1064
aVand what makes matters even worse is that we see a world celebrating this bad deal, rushing to embrace and do business with a regime openly committed to our destruction.
p1065
aVlast week, major general salehi, the commander of iran\u2019s army, proclaimed this: \u201cwe will annihilate israel for sure.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cwe are glad that we are in the forefront of executing the supreme leader\u2019s order to destroy israel.\u201d\u000a\u000aand as for the supreme leader himself, a few days after the nuclear deal was announced, he released his latest book.
p1066
aVhere it is.
p1067
aVit\u2019s a 400-page screed detailing his plan to destroy the state of israel.
p1068
aVlast month, khamenei once again made his genocidal intentions clear before iran\u2019s top clerical body, the assembly of experts.
p1069
aVhe spoke about israel, home to over six million jews.
p1070
aVhe pledged, \u201cthere will be no israel in 25 years.\u201d\u000a\u000aseventy years after the murder of six million jews, iran\u2019s rulers promise to destroy my country.
p1071
aVmurder my people.
p1072
aVand the response from this body, the response from nearly every one of the governments represented here has been absolutely nothing!
p1073
aVperhaps you can now understand why israel is not joining you in celebrating this deal.
p1074
aVif iran\u2019s rulers were working to destroy your countries, perhaps you\u2019d be less enthusiastic about the deal.
p1075
aVif iran\u2019s terror proxies were firing thousands of rockets at your cities, perhaps you\u2019d be more measured in your praise.
p1076
aVand if this deal were unleashing a nuclear arms race in your neighborhood, perhaps you\u2019d be more reluctant to celebrate.
p1077
aVbut don\u2019t think that iran is only a danger to israel.
p1078
aVbesides iran\u2019s aggression in the middle east and its terror around the world, iran is also building intercontinental ballistic missiles whose sole purpose is to carry nuclear warheads.
p1079
aVnow remember this: iran already has missiles that can reach israel.
p1080
aVso those intercontinental ballistic missiles that iran is building \u2013 they\u2019re not meant for us \u2013 they\u2019re meant for you.
p1081
aVfor europe.
p1082
aVfor america.
p1083
aVfor raining down mass destruction \u2013 anytime, anywhere.
p1084
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000ait\u2019s not easy to oppose something that is embraced by the greatest powers in the world.
p1085
aVbelieve me, it would be far easier to remain silent.
p1086
aVbut throughout our history, the jewish people have learned the heavy price of silence.
p1087
aVand as the prime minister of the jewish state, as someone who knows that history, i refuse to be silent.
p1088
aVi\u2019ll say it again: the days when the jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies \u2013 those days are over.
p1089
aVnot being passive means speaking up about those dangers.
p1090
aVwe have.
p1091
aVwe are.
p1092
aVwe will.
p1093
aVnot being passive also means defending ourselves against those dangers.
p1094
aVwe have.
p1095
aVwe are.
p1096
aVand we will.
p1097
aVisrael will not allow iran to break-in, to sneak-in or to walk-in to the nuclear weapons club.
p1098
aVi know that preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons remains the official policy of the international community.
p1099
aVbut no one should question israel\u2019s determination to defend itself against those who seek our destruction.
p1100
aVfor in every generation, there were those who rose up to destroy our people.
p1101
aVin antiquity, we faced destruction from the ancient empires of babylon and rome.
p1102
aVin the middle ages, we faced inquisition and expulsion.
p1103
aVand in modern times, we faced pogroms and the holocaust.
p1104
aVyet the jewish people persevered.
p1105
aVand now another regime has arisen, swearing to destroy israel.
p1106
aVthat regime would be wise to consider this: i stand here today representing israel, a country 67 years young, but the nation-state of a people nearly 4,000 years old.
p1107
aVyet the empires of babylon and rome are not represented in this hall of nations.
p1108
aVneither is the thousand year reich.
p1109
aVthose seemingly invincible empires are long gone.
p1110
aVbut israel lives.
p1111
aVthe people of israel live.
p1112
aVam israel hai\u000a\u000athe re-birth of israel is a testament to the indomitable spirit of my people.
p1113
aVfor a hundred generations, the jewish people dreamed of returning to the land of israel.
p1114
aVeven in our darkest hours, and we had so many, even in our darkest hours we never gave up hope of rebuilding our eternal capital jerusalem.
p1115
aVthe establishment of israel made realizing that dream possible.
p1116
aVit has enabled us to live as a free people in our ancestral homeland.
p1117
aVit\u2019s enabled us to embrace jews who\u2019ve come from the four corners of the earth to find refuge from persecution.
p1118
aVthey came from war-torn europe, from yemen, iraq, morocco, from ethiopia and the soviet union, from a hundred other lands.
p1119
aVand today, as a rising tide of anti-semitism once again sweeps across europe and elsewhere, many jews come to israel to join us in building the jewish future.
p1120
aVso here\u2019s my message to the rulers of iran: your plan to destroy israel will fail.
p1121
aVisrael will not permit any force on earth to threaten its future.
p1122
aVand here\u2019s my message to all the countries represented here: whatever resolutions you may adopt in this building, whatever decisions you may take in your capitals, israel will do whatever it must do to defend our state and to defend our people.
p1123
aVdistinguished delegates,\u000a\u000aas this deal with iran moves ahead, i hope you\u2019ll enforce it\u2026how can i put this?
p1124
aVwith a little more rigor than you showed with the six security council resolutions that iran has systematically violated and which now have been effectively discarded.
p1125
aVmake sure that the inspectors actually inspect.
p1126
aVmake sure that the snapback sanctions actually snap back.
p1127
aVand make sure that iran\u2019s violations aren\u2019t swept under the persian rug.
p1128
aVwell, of one thing i can assure you: israel will be watching\u2026 closely.
p1129
aVwhat the international community now needs to do is clear: first, make iran comply with all its nuclear obligations.
p1130
aVkeep iran\u2019s feet to the fire.
p1131
aVsecond, check iran\u2019s regional aggression.
p1132
aVsupport and strengthen those fighting iran\u2019s aggression, beginning with israel.
p1133
aVthird, use sanctions and all the tools available to you to tear down iran\u2019s global terror network.
p1134
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000aisrael is working closely with our arab peace partners to address our common security challenges from iran and also the security challenges from isis and from others.
p1135
aVwe are also working with other states in the middle east as well as countries in africa, in asia and beyond.
p1136
aVmany in our region know that both iran and isis are our common enemies.
p1137
aVand when your enemies fight each other, don\u2019t strengthen either one \u2013 weaken both.
p1138
aVcommon dangers are clearly bringing israel and its arab neighbors closer.
p1139
aVand as we work together to thwart those dangers, i hope we\u2019ll build lasting partnerships \u2013 lasting partnerships for security, for prosperity and for peace.
p1140
aVbut in israel, we never forget one thing.
p1141
aVwe never forget that the most important partner that israel has has always been, and will always be, the united states of america.
p1142
aVthe alliance between israel and the united states is unshakeable.
p1143
aVpresident obama and i agree on the need to keep arms out of the hands of iran\u2019s terror proxies.
p1144
aVwe agree on the need to stop iran from destabilizing countries throughout the middle east.
p1145
aVisrael deeply appreciates president obama\u2019s willingness to bolster our security, help israel maintain its qualitative military edge and help israel confront the enormous challenges we face.
p1146
aVisrael is grateful that this sentiment is widely shared by the american people and its representatives in congress, by both those who supported the deal and by those who opposed it.
p1147
aVpresident obama and i have both said that our differences over the nuclear deal are a disagreement within the family.
p1148
aVbut we have no disagreement about the need to work together to secure our common future.
p1149
aVand what a great future it could be.
p1150
aVisrael is uniquely poised to seize the promise of the 21st century.
p1151
aVisrael is a world leader in science and technology, in cyber, software, water, agriculture, medicine, biotechnology and so many other fields that are being revolutionized by israeli ingenuity and israeli innovation.
p1152
aVisrael is the innovation nation.
p1153
aVisraeli knowhow is everywhere.
p1154
aVit\u2019s in your computers\u2019 microprocessors and flash drives.
p1155
aVit\u2019s in your smartphones, when you send instant messages and navigate your cars.
p1156
aVit\u2019s on your farms, when you drip irrigate your crops and keep your grains and produce fresh.
p1157
aVit\u2019s in your universities, when you study nobel prize winning discoveries in chemistry and economics.
p1158
aVit\u2019s in your medicine cabinets, when you use drugs to treat parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis.
p1159
aVit\u2019s even on your plate, when you eat the delicious cherry tomato.
p1160
aVthat too was perfected in israel, in case you didn\u2019t know.
p1161
aVwe are so proud in israel of the long strides our country has made in a short time.
p1162
aVwe\u2019re so proud that our small country is making such a huge contribution to the entire world.
p1163
aVyet the dreams of our people, enshrined for eternity by the great prophets of the bible, those dreams will be fully realized only when there is peace.
p1164
aVas the middle east descends into chaos, israel\u2019s peace agreements with egypt and jordan are two cornerstones of stability.
p1165
aVisrael remains committed to achieving peace with the palestinians as well.
p1166
aVisraelis know the price of war.
p1167
aVi know the price of war.
p1168
aVi was nearly killed in battle.
p1169
aVi lost many friends.
p1170
aVi lost my beloved brother yoni.
p1171
aVthose who know the price of war can best appreciate what the blessings of peace would mean \u2013 for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren.
p1172
aVi am prepared to immediately, immediately, resume direct peace negotiations with the palestinian authority without any preconditions whatsoever.
p1173
aVunfortunately, president abbas said yesterday that he is not prepared to do this.
p1174
aVwell, i hope he changes his mind.
p1175
aVbecause i remain committed to a vision of two states for two peoples, in which a demilitarized palestinian state recognizes the jewish state.
p1176
aVyou know, the peace process began over two decades ago.
p1177
aVyet despite the best efforts of six israeli prime ministers \u2013 rabin, peres, barak, sharon, olmert and myself \u2013 the palestinians have consistently refused to end the conflict and make a final peace with israel.
p1178
aVand unfortunately, you heard that rejectionism again only yesterday from president abbas.
p1179
aVhow can israel make peace with a palestinian partner who refuses to even sit at the negotiating table?
p1180
aVisrael expects the palestinian authority to abide by its commitments.
p1181
aVthe palestinians should not walk away from peace.
p1182
aVpresident abbas, i know it\u2019s not easy.
p1183
aVi know it\u2019s hard.
p1184
aVbut we owe it to our peoples to try, to continue to try, because together, if we actually negotiate and stop negotiating about the negotiation, if we actually sit down and try to resolve this conflict between us, recognize each other, not use a palestinian state as a stepping stone for another islamist dictatorship in the middle east, but something that will live at peace next to the jewish state, if we actually do that, we can do remarkable things for our peoples.
p1185
aVthe un can help advance peace by supporting direct, unconditional negotiations between the parties.
p1186
aVthe un won\u2019t help peace, certainly won\u2019t help advance peace by trying to impose solutions or by encouraging palestinian rejectionism.
p1187
aVand the un, distinguished delegates, should do one more thing.
p1188
aVthe un should finally rid itself of the obsessive bashing of israel.
p1189
aVhere\u2019s just one absurd example of this obsession: in four years of horrific violence in syria, more than a quarter of a million people have lost their lives.
p1190
aVthat\u2019s more than ten times, more than ten times, the number of israelis and palestinians combined who have lost their lives in a century of conflict between us.
p1191
aVyet last year, this assembly adopted 20 resolutions against israel and just one resolution about the savage slaughter in syria.
p1192
aVtalk about injustice.
p1193
aVtalk about disproportionality.
p1194
aVtwenty.
p1195
aVcount them.
p1196
aVone against syria.
p1197
aVwell, frankly i am not surprised.
p1198
aVto borrow a line from yogi berra, the late, great baseball player and part time philosopher: when it comes to the annual bashing of israel at the un, it\u2019s dj vu all over again.
p1199
aVenough!
p1200
aVthirty one years after i stood here for the first time, i\u2019m still asking: when will the un finally check its anti-israel fanaticism at the door?
p1201
aVwhen will the un finally stop slandering israel as a threat to peace and actually start helping israel advance peace?
p1202
aVand the same question should be posed to palestinian leaders.
p1203
aVwhen will you start working with israel to advance peace and reconciliation and stop libeling israel, stop inciting hatred and violence?
p1204
aVpresident abbas, here\u2019s a good place to begin: stop spreading lies about israel\u2019s alleged intentions on the temple mount.
p1205
aVisrael is fully committed to maintaining the status quo there.
p1206
aVwhat president abbas should be speaking out against are the actions of militant islamists who are smuggling explosives into the al-aqsa mosque and who are trying to prevent jews and christians from visiting the holy sites.
p1207
aVthat\u2019s the real threat to these sacred sites.
p1208
aVa thousand years before the birth of christianity, more than 1,500 years before the birth of islam, king david made jerusalem our capital, and king solomon built the temple on that mount.
p1209
aVyet israel, israel will always respect the sacred shrines of all.
p1210
aVin a region plagued by violence and by unimaginable intolerance, in which islamic fanatics are destroying the ancient treasures of civilization, israel stands out as a towering beacon of enlightenment and tolerance.
p1211
aVfar from endangering the holy sites, it is israel that ensures their safety.
p1212
aVbecause unlike the powers who have ruled jerusalem in the past, israel respects the holy sites and freedom of worship of all \u2013 jews, muslims, christians, everyone.
p1213
aVand that, ladies and gentlemen, will never change.
p1214
aVbecause israel will always stay true to its values.
p1215
aVthese values are on display each and every day: when israel\u2019s feisty parliament vigorously debates every issue under the sun.
p1216
aVwhen israel\u2019s chief justice sits in her chair at our fiercely independent supreme court.
p1217
aVwhen our christian community continues to grow and thrive from year to year, as christian communities are decimated elsewhere in the middle east.
p1218
aVwhen a brilliant young israeli muslim student gives her valedictorian address at one of our finest universities.
p1219
aVand when israeli doctors and nurses \u2013 doctors and nurses from the israeli military \u2013 treat thousands of wounded from the killing fields of syria and thousands more in the wake of natural disasters from haiti to nepal.
p1220
aVthis is the true face of israel.
p1221
aVthese are the values of israel.
p1222
aVand in the middle east, these values are under savage assault by militant islamists who are forcing millions of terrified people to flee to distant shores.
p1223
aVten miles from isis, a few hundred yards from iran\u2019s murderous proxies, israel stands in the breach \u2013 proudly and courageously, defending freedom and progress.
p1224
aVisrael is civilization\u2019s front line in the battle against barbarism.
p1225
aVso here\u2019s a novel idea for the united nations: instead of continuing the shameful routine of bashing israel, stand with israel.
p1226
aVstand with israel as we check the fanaticism at our door.
p1227
aVstand with israel as we prevent that fanaticism from reaching your door.
p1228
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000astand with israel because israel is not just defending itself.
p1229
aVmore than ever, israel is defending you.
p1230
aVwhat i\u2019m about to say is going to shock you: israel has a bright future at the un.
p1231
aVnow i know that hearing that from me must surely come as a surprise, because year after year i\u2019ve stood at this very podium and slammed the un for its obsessive bias against israel.
p1232
aVand the un deserved every scathing word \u2013 for the disgrace of the general assembly that last year passed 20 resolutions against the democratic state of israel and a grand total of three resolutions against all the other countries on the planet.
p1233
aVisrael \u2013 twenty; rest of the world \u2013 three.
p1234
aVand what about the joke called the un human rights council, which each year condemns israel more than all the countries of the world combined.
p1235
aVas women are being systematically raped, murdered, sold into slavery across the world, which is the only country that the un\u2019s commission on women chose to condemn this year?
p1236
aVyep, you guessed it \u2013 israel.
p1237
aVisrael.
p1238
aVisrael where women fly fighter jets, lead major corporations, head universities, preside \u2013 twice \u2013 over the supreme court, and have served as speaker of the knesset and prime minister.
p1239
aVand this circus continues at unesco.
p1240
aVunesco, the un body charged with preserving world heritage.
p1241
aVnow, this is hard to believe but unesco just denied the 4,000-year connection between the jewish people and its holiest site, the temple mount.
p1242
aVthat\u2019s just as absurd as denying the connection between the great wall of china and china.
p1243
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000athe un, begun as a moral force, has become a moral farce.
p1244
aVso when it comes to israel at the un, you\u2019d probably think nothing will ever change, right?
p1245
aVwell think again.
p1246
aVyou see, everything will change and a lot sooner than you think.
p1247
aVthe change will happen in this hall, because back home, your governments are rapidly changing their attitudes towards israel.
p1248
aVand sooner or later, that\u2019s going to change the way you vote on israel at the un.
p1249
aVthe un, begun as a moral force, has become a moral farce.
p1250
aVmore and more nations in asia, in africa, in latin america, more and more nations see israel as a potent partner \u2013 a partner in fighting the terrorism of today, a partner in developing the technology of tomorrow.
p1251
aVtoday israel has diplomatic relations with over 160 countries.
p1252
aVthat\u2019s nearly double the number that we had when i served here as israel\u2019s ambassador some 30 years ago.
p1253
aVand those ties are getting broader and deeper every day.
p1254
aVworld leaders increasingly appreciate that israel is a powerful country with one of the best intelligence services on earth.
p1255
aVbecause of our unmatched experience and proven capabilities in fighting terrorism, many of your governments seek our help in keeping your countries safe.
p1256
aVmany also seek to benefit from israel\u2019s ingenuity in agriculture, in health, in water, in cyber and in the fusion of big data, connectivity and artificial intelligence \u2013 that fusion that is changing our world in every way.
p1257
aVyou might consider this: israel leads the world in recycling wastewater.
p1258
aVwe recycle about 90% of our wastewater.
p1259
aVnow, how remarkable is that?
p1260
aVwell, given that the next country on the list only recycles about 20% of its wastewater, israel is a global water power.
p1261
aVso if you have a thirsty world, and we do, there\u2019s no better ally than israel.
p1262
aVhow about cybersecurity?
p1263
aVthat\u2019s an issue that affects everyone.
p1264
aVisrael accounts for one-tenth of one percent of the world\u2019s population, yet last year we attracted some 20% of the global private investment in cybersecurity.
p1265
aVi want you to digest that number.
p1266
aVin cyber, israel is punching a whopping 200 times above its weight.
p1267
aVso israel is also a global cyber power.
p1268
aVif hackers are targeting your banks, your planes, your power grids and just about everything else, israel can offer indispensable help.
p1269
aVgovernments are changing their attitudes towards israel because they know that israel can help them protect their peoples, can help them feed them, can help them better their lives.
p1270
aVgovernments are changing their attitudes towards israel because they know that israel can help them protect their peoples, can help them feed them, can help them better their lives.
p1271
aVthis summer i had an unbelievable opportunity to see this change so vividly during an unforgettable visit to four african countries.
p1272
aVthis is the first visit to africa by an israeli prime minister in decades.
p1273
aVlater today, i\u2019ll be meeting with leaders from 17 african countries.
p1274
aVwe\u2019ll discuss how israeli technology can help them in their efforts to transform their countries.
p1275
aVin africa, things are changing.
p1276
aVin china, india, russia, japan, attitudes towards israel have changed as well.
p1277
aVthese powerful nations know that, despite israel\u2019s small size, it can make a big difference in many, many areas that are important to them.
p1278
aVbut now i\u2019m going to surprise you even more.
p1279
aVyou see, the biggest change in attitudes towards israel is taking place elsewhere.
p1280
aVit\u2019s taking place in the arab world.
p1281
aVour peace treaties with egypt and jordan continue to be anchors of stability in the volatile middle east.
p1282
aVbut i have to tell you this: for the first time in my lifetime, many other states in the region recognize that israel is not their enemy.
p1283
aVthey recognize that israel is their ally.
p1284
aVour common enemies are iran and isis.
p1285
aVour common goals are security, prosperity and peace.
p1286
aVi believe that in the years ahead we will work together to achieve these goals, work together openly.
p1287
aVso israel\u2019s diplomatic relations are undergoing nothing less than a revolution.
p1288
aVbut in this revolution, we never forget that our most cherished alliance, our deepest friendship is with the united states of america, the most powerful and the most generous nation on earth.
p1289
aVour unbreakable bond with the united states of america transcends parties and politics.
p1290
aVit reflects, above all else, the overwhelming support for israel among the american people, support which is at record highs and for which we are deeply grateful.
p1291
aVi believe the day is not far off when israel will be able to rely on many, many countries to stand with us at the un.
p1292
aVslowly but surely, the days when un ambassadors reflexively condemn israel, those days are coming to an end.
p1293
aVthe united nations denounces israel; the united states supports israel.
p1294
aVand a central pillar of that defense has been america\u2019s consistent support for israel at the un.
p1295
aVi appreciate president obama\u2019s commitment to that longstanding us policy.
p1296
aVin fact, the only time that the united states cast a un security council veto during the obama presidency was against an anti-israel resolution in 2011. as president obama rightly declared at this podium, peace will not come from statements and resolutions at the united nations.
p1297
aVi believe the day is not far off when israel will be able to rely on many, many countries to stand with us at the un.
p1298
aVslowly but surely, the days when un ambassadors reflexively condemn israel, those days are coming to an end.
p1299
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000atoday\u2019s automatic majority against israel at the un reminds me of the story, the incredible story of hiroo onada.
p1300
aVhiroo was a japanese soldier who was sent to the philippines in 1944. he lived in the jungle.
p1301
aVhe scavenged for food.
p1302
aVhe evaded capture.
p1303
aVeventually he surrendered, but that didn\u2019t happen until 1974, some 30 years after world war ii ended.
p1304
aVfor decades, hiroo refused to believe the war was over.
p1305
aVas hiroo was hiding in the jungle, japanese tourists were swimming in pools in american luxury hotels in nearby manila.
p1306
aVfinally, mercifully, hiroo\u2019s former commanding officer was sent to persuade him to come out of hiding.
p1307
aVonly then did hiroo lay down his arms.
p1308
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000adistinguished delegates from so many lands,\u000a\u000ai have one message for you today: lay down your arms.
p1309
aVthe war against israel at the un is over.
p1310
aVperhaps some of you don\u2019t know it yet, but i am confident that one day in the not too distant future you will also get the message from your president or from your prime minister informing you that the war against israel at the united nations has ended.
p1311
aVyes, i know, there might be a storm before the calm.
p1312
aVi know there is talk about ganging up on israel at the un later this year.
p1313
aVgiven its history of hostility towards israel, does anyone really believe that israel will let the un determine our security and our vital national interests?
p1314
aVwe will not accept any attempt by the un to dictate terms to israel.
p1315
aVthe road to peace runs through jerusalem and ramallah, not through new york.
p1316
aVbut regardless of what happens in the months ahead, i have total confidence that in the years ahead the revolution in israel\u2019s standing among the nations will finally penetrate this hall of nations.
p1317
aVi have so much confidence, in fact, that i predict that a decade from now an israeli prime minister will stand right here where i am standing and actually applaud the un.
p1318
aVbut i want to ask you: why do we have to wait a decade?
p1319
aVwhy keep vilifying israel?
p1320
aVperhaps because some of you don\u2019t appreciate that the obsessive bias against israel is not just a problem for my country, it\u2019s a problem for your countries too.
p1321
aVbecause if the un spends so much time condemning the only liberal democracy in the middle east, it has far less time to address war, disease, poverty, climate change and all the other serious problems that plague the planet.
p1322
aVare the half million slaughtered syrians helped by your condemnation of israel?
p1323
aVthe same israel that has treated thousands of injured syrians in our hospitals, including a field hospital that i built right along the golan heights border with syria.
p1324
aVare the gays hanging from cranes in iran helped by your denigration of israel?
p1325
aVthat same israel where gays march proudly in our streets and serve in our parliament, including i\u2019m proud to say in my own likud party.
p1326
aVare the starving children in north korea\u2019s brutal tyranny, are they helped by your demonization of israel?
p1327
aVisrael, whose agricultural knowhow is feeding the hungry throughout the developing world?
p1328
aVthe sooner the un\u2019s obsession with israel ends, the better.
p1329
aVthe better for israel, the better for your countries, the better for the un itself.
p1330
aVthe sooner the un\u2019s obsession with israel ends, the better.
p1331
aVthe better for israel, the better for your countries, the better for the un itself.
p1332
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000aif un habits die hard, palestinian habits die even harder.
p1333
aVpresident abbas just attacked from this podium the balfour declaration.
p1334
aVhe\u2019s preparing a lawsuit against britain for that declaration from 1917. that\u2019s almost 100 years ago \u2013 talk about being stuck in the past.
p1335
aVthe palestinians may just as well sue iran for the cyrus declaration, which enabled the jews to rebuild our temple in jerusalem 2,500 years ago.
p1336
aVcome to think of it, why not a palestinian class action suit against abraham for buying that plot of land in hebron where the fathers and mothers of the jewish people were buried 4,000 years ago?
p1337
aVyou\u2019re not laughing.
p1338
aVit\u2019s as absurd as that.
p1339
aVto sue the british government for the balfour declaration?
p1340
aVis he kidding?
p1341
aVand this is taken seriously here?
p1342
aVpresident abbas attacked the balfour declaration because it recognized the right of the jewish people to a national home in the land of israel.
p1343
aVwhen the united nations supported the establishment of a jewish state in 1947, it recognized our historical and our moral rights in our homeland and to our homeland.
p1344
aVyet today, nearly 70 years later, the palestinians still refuse to recognize those rights \u2013 not our right to a homeland, not our right to a state, not our right to anything.
p1345
aVand this remains the true core of the conflict, the persistent palestinian refusal to recognize the jewish state in any boundary.
p1346
aVyou see, this conflict is not about the settlements.
p1347
aVit never was.
p1348
aVthe conflict raged for decades before there was a single settlement, when judea samaria and gaza were all in arab hands.
p1349
aVthe west bank and gaza were in arab hands and they attacked us again and again and again.
p1350
aVand when we uprooted all 21 settlements in gaza and withdrew from every last inch of gaza, we didn\u2019t get peace from gaza \u2013 we got thousands of rockets fired at us from gaza.
p1351
aVthis conflict rages because for the palestinians, the real settlements they\u2019re after are haifa, jaffa and tel aviv.
p1352
aVthe issue of settlements is a real one and it can and must be resolved in final status negotiations.
p1353
aVnow mind you, the issue of settlements is a real one and it can and must be resolved in final status negotiations.
p1354
aVbut this conflict has never been about the settlements or about establishing a palestinian state.
p1355
aVit\u2019s always been about the existence of a jewish state, a jewish state in any boundary.
p1356
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000aisrael is ready, i am ready to negotiate all final status issues but one thing i will never negotiate: our right to the one and only jewish state.
p1357
aVwow, sustained applause for the prime minister of israel in the general assembly?
p1358
aVthe change may be coming sooner than i thought.
p1359
aVhad the palestinians said yes to a jewish state in 1947, there would have been no war, no refugees and no conflict.
p1360
aVand when the palestinians finally say yes to a jewish state, we will be able to end this conflict once and for all.
p1361
aVnow here\u2019s the tragedy, because, see, the palestinians are not only trapped in the past, their leaders are poisoning the future.
p1362
aVi want you to imagine a day in the life of a 13-year-old palestinian boy, i\u2019ll call him ali.
p1363
aVali wakes up before school, he goes to practice with a soccer team named after dalal mughrabi, a palestinian terrorist responsible for the murder of a busload of 37 israelis.
p1364
aVat school, ali attends an event sponsored by the palestinian ministry of education honoring baha alyan, who last year murdered three israeli civilians.
p1365
aVon his walk home, ali looks up at a towering statue erected just a few weeks ago by the palestinian authority to honor abu sukar, who detonated a bomb in the center of jerusalem, killing 15 israelis.
p1366
aVwhen ali gets home, he turns on the tv and sees an interview with a senior palestinian official, jibril rajoub, who says that if he had a nuclear bomb, he\u2019d detonate it over israel that very day.
p1367
aVali then turns on the radio and he hears president abbas\u2019s adviser, sultan abu al-einein, urging palestinians, here\u2019s a quote, \u201cto slit the throats of israelis wherever you find them.\u201d ali checks his facebook and he sees a recent post by president abbas\u2019s fatah party calling the massacre of 11 israeli athletes at the munich olympics a \u201cheroic act\u201d.
p1368
aVon youtube, ali watches a clip of president abbas himself saying, \u201cwe welcome every drop of blood spilled in jerusalem.\u201d direct quote.
p1369
aVover dinner, ali asks his mother what would happen if he killed a jew and went to an israeli prison?
p1370
aVhere\u2019s what she tells him.
p1371
aVshe tells him he\u2019d be paid thousands of dollars each month by the palestinian authority.
p1372
aVin fact, she tells him, the more jews he would kill, the more money he\u2019d get.
p1373
aVoh, and when he gets out of prison, ali would be guaranteed a job with the palestinian authority.
p1374
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000aall this is real.
p1375
aVit happens every day, all the time.
p1376
aVsadly, ali represents hundreds of thousands of palestinian children who are indoctrinated with hate every moment, every hour.
p1377
aVthis is child abuse.
p1378
aVimagine your child undergoing this brainwashing.
p1379
aVimagine what it takes for a young boy or girl to break free out of this culture of hate.
p1380
aVsome do but far too many don\u2019t.
p1381
aVhow can any of us expect young palestinians to support peace when their leaders poison their minds against peace?
p1382
aVhow can any of us expect young palestinians to support peace when their leaders poison their minds against peace?
p1383
aVwe in israel don\u2019t do this.
p1384
aVwe educate our children for peace.
p1385
aVin fact, we recently launched a pilot program, my government did, to make the study of arabic mandatory for jewish children so that we can better understand each other, so that we can live together side-by-side in peace.
p1386
aVof course, like all societies israel has fringe elements.
p1387
aVbut it\u2019s our response to those fringe elements, it\u2019s our response to those fringe elements that makes all the difference.
p1388
aVtake the tragic case of ahmed dawabsha.
p1389
aVi\u2019ll never forget visiting ahmed in the hospital just hours after he was attacked.
p1390
aVa little boy, really a baby, he was badly burned.
p1391
aVahmed was the victim of a horrible terrorist act perpetrated by jews.
p1392
aVhe lay bandaged and unconscious as israeli doctors worked around the clock to save him.
p1393
aVno words can bring comfort to this boy or to his family.
p1394
aVstill, as i stood by his bedside i told his uncle, \u201cthis is not our people.
p1395
aVthis is not our way.\u201d i then ordered extraordinary measures to bring ahmed\u2019s assailants to justice and today the jewish citizens of israel accused of attacking the dawabsha family are in jail awaiting trial.
p1396
aVnow, for some, this story shows that both sides have their extremists and both sides are equally responsible for this seemingly endless conflict.
p1397
aVbut what ahmed\u2019s story actually proves is the very opposite.
p1398
aVit illustrates the profound difference between our two societies, because while israeli leaders condemn terrorists, all terrorists, arabs and jews alike, palestinian leaders celebrate terrorists.
p1399
aVwhile israel jails the handful of jewish terrorists among us, the palestinians pay thousands of terrorists among them.
p1400
aVso i call on president abbas: you have a choice to make.
p1401
aVyou can continue to stoke hatred as you did today or you can finally confront hatred and work with me to establish peace between our two peoples.
p1402
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000ai hear the buzz.
p1403
aVi know that many of you have given up on peace.
p1404
aVbut i want you to know \u2013 i have not given up on peace.
p1405
aVi remain committed to a vision of peace based on two states for two peoples.
p1406
aVi believe as never before that changes taking place in the arab world today offer a unique opportunity to advance that peace.
p1407
aVi commend president el-sissi of egypt for his efforts to advance peace and stability in our region.
p1408
aVisrael welcomes the spirit of the arab peace initiative and welcomes a dialogue with arab states to advance a broader peace.
p1409
aVi believe that for that broader peace to be fully achieved the palestinians have to be part of it.
p1410
aVi\u2019m ready to begin negotiations to achieve this today \u2013 not tomorrow, not next week, today.
p1411
aVpresident abbas spoke here an hour ago.
p1412
aVwouldn\u2019t it be better if instead of speaking past each other we were speaking to one another?
p1413
aVpresident abbas, instead of railing against israel at the united nations in new york, i invite you to speak to the israeli people at the knesset in jerusalem.
p1414
aVand i would gladly come to speak to the palestinian parliament in ramallah.
p1415
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000awhile israel seeks peace with all our neighbors, we also know that peace has no greater enemy than the forces of militant islam.
p1416
aVthe bloody trail of this fanaticism runs through all the continents represented here.
p1417
aVit runs through paris and nice, brussels and baghdad, tel aviv and jerusalem, minnesota and new york, from sydney to san bernardino.
p1418
aVso many have suffered its savagery: christian and jews, women and gays, yazidis and kurds and many, many others.
p1419
aVyet the heaviest price, the heaviest price of all has been paid by innocent muslims.
p1420
aVhundreds of thousands unmercifully slaughtered.
p1421
aVmillions turned into desperate refugees, tens of millions brutally subjugated.
p1422
aVthe defeat of militant islam will thus be a victory for all humanity, but it would especially be a victory for those many muslims who seek a life without fear, a life of peace, a life of hope.
p1423
aVbut to defeat the forces of militant islam, we must fight them relentlessly.
p1424
aVwe must fight them in the real world.
p1425
aVwe must fight them in the virtual world.
p1426
aVwe must dismantle their networks, disrupt their funding, discredit their ideology.
p1427
aVwe can defeat them and we will defeat them.
p1428
aVmedievalism is no match for modernity.
p1429
aVhope is stronger than hate, freedom mightier than fear.
p1430
aVwe can do this.
p1431
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000aisrael fights this fateful battle against the forces of militant islam every day.
p1432
aVwe keep our borders safe from isis, we prevent the smuggling of game-changing weapons to hezbollah in lebanon, we thwart palestinian terror attacks in judea and samaria, the west bank, and we deter missile attacks from hamas-controlled gaza.
p1433
aVthat\u2019s the same hamas terror organization that cruelly, unbelievably cruelly refuses to return three of our citizens and the bodies of our fallen soldiers, oron shaul and hadar goldin.
p1434
aVhadar goldin\u2019s parents, leah and simcha goldin, are here with us today.
p1435
aVthey have one request \u2013 to bury their beloved son in israel.
p1436
aVall they ask for is one simple thing \u2013 to be able to visit the grave of their fallen son hadar in israel.
p1437
aVhamas refuses.
p1438
aVthey couldn\u2019t care less.
p1439
aVi implore you to stand with them, with us, with all that\u2019s decent in our world against the inhumanity of hamas \u2013 all that is indecent and barbaric.
p1440
aVhamas breaks every humanitarian rule in the book, throw the book at them.
p1441
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000athe greatest threat to my country, to our region, and ultimately to our world remains the militant islamic regime of iran.
p1442
aVthe greatest threat to my country, to our region, and ultimately to our world remains the militant islamic regime of iran.
p1443
aViran openly seeks israel\u2019s annihilation.
p1444
aVit threatens countries across the middle east, it sponsors terror worldwide.
p1445
aVthis year, iran has fired ballistic missiles in direct defiance of security council resolutions.
p1446
aVit has expended its aggression in iraq, in syria, in yemen.
p1447
aViran, the world\u2019s foremost sponsor of terrorism continued to build its global terror network.
p1448
aVthat terror network now spans five continents.
p1449
aVso my point to you is this: the threat iran poses to all of us is not behind us, it\u2019s before us.
p1450
aVin the coming years, there must be a sustained and united effort to push back against iran\u2019s aggression and iran\u2019s terror.
p1451
aVwith the nuclear constraints on iran one year closer to being removed, let me be clear: israel will not allow the terrorist regime in iran to develop nuclear weapons \u2013 not now, not in a decade, not ever.
p1452
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000ai stand before you today at a time when israel\u2019s former president, shimon peres, is fighting for his life.
p1453
aVshimon is one of israel\u2019s founding fathers, one of its boldest statesmen, one of its most respected leaders.
p1454
aVi know you will all join me and join all the people of israel in wishing him refuah shlemah shimon, a speedy recovery.
p1455
aVi\u2019ve always admired shimon\u2019s boundless optimism, and like him, i too am filled with hope.
p1456
aVi am filled with hope because israel is capable of defending itself by itself against any threat.
p1457
aVi am filled with hope because the valor of our fighting men and women is second to none.
p1458
aVi am filled with hope because i know the forces of civilization will ultimately triumph over the forces of terror.
p1459
aVi am filled with hope because in the age of innovation, israel \u2013 the innovation nation \u2013 is thriving as never before.
p1460
aVi am filled with hope because israel works tirelessly to advance equality and opportunity for all its citizens: jews, muslims, christians, druze, everyone.
p1461
aVand i am filled with hope because despite all the naysayers, i believe that in the years ahead, israel will forge a lasting peace with all our neighbors.
p1462
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000ai am hopeful about what israel can accomplish because i\u2019ve seen what israel has accomplished.
p1463
aVin 1948, the year of israel\u2019s independence, our population was 800,000. our main export was oranges.
p1464
aVpeople said then we were too small, too weak, too isolated, too demographically outnumbered to survive, let alone thrive.
p1465
aVthe skeptics were wrong about israel then; the skeptics are wrong about israel now.
p1466
aVisrael\u2019s population has grown tenfold, our economy fortyfold.
p1467
aVtoday our biggest export is technology \u2013 israeli technology, which powers the world\u2019s computers, cellphones, cars and so much more.
p1468
aVladies and gentlemen,\u000a\u000athe future belongs to those who innovate and this is why the future belongs to countries like israel.
p1469
aVisrael wants to be your partner in seizing that future, so i call on all of you: cooperate with israel, embrace israel, dream with israel.
p1470
aVdream of the future that we can build together, a future of breathtaking progress, a future of security, prosperity and peace, a future of hope for all humanity, a future where even at the un, even in this hall, israel will finally, inevitably, take its rightful place among the nations.
p1471
aVthank you.
p1472
aVmr. president, ladies and gentlemen, we're in the midst of a great revolution.
p1473
aVa revolution in israel's standing among the nations.
p1474
aVthis is happening because so many countries around the world have finally woken up to what israel can do for them.
p1475
aVthose countries now recognize what brilliant investors, like warren buffet, and great companies, like google and intel, what they've recognized and known for years: that israel is the innovation nation.
p1476
aVthe place for cutting-edge technology and agriculture, in water, in cybersecurity, in medicine, in autonomous vehicles.
p1477
aVyou name it, we've got it.
p1478
aVthose countries now also recognize israel's exceptional capabilities in fighting terrorism.
p1479
aVin recent years, israel has provided intelligence that has prevented dozens of major terrorist attacks around the world.
p1480
aVwe have saved countless lives.
p1481
aVnow, you may not know this, but your governments do, and they're working closely together with israel to keep your countries safe and your citizens safe.
p1482
aVi stood here last year on this podium, and i spoke about this profound change in israel's standing around the world.
p1483
aVand just look at what has happened since, in one year.
p1484
aVhundreds of presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers and other leaders have visited israel, many for the first time.
p1485
aVof these many visits, two were truly historic.
p1486
aVin may, president trump became the first american president to include israel in his first visit abroad.
p1487
aVpresident trump stood at the western wall, at the foot of the temple mount, where the jewish people - or rather the jewish people's temples stood for nearly 1,000 years, and when the president touched those ancient stones, he touched our hearts forever.
p1488
aVin july, prime minister modi became the first indian prime minister to visit israel.
p1489
aVyou may have seen ten pictures.
p1490
aVwe were on a beach in hadera, we rode together in a jeep outfitted with a portable desalination device that some thriving israeli entrepreneur invented.
p1491
aVwe took off our shoes, waded into the mediterranean, and drank seawater that had been purified only a few minutes earlier.
p1492
aVwe imagined the endless possibilities for india, for israel, for all of humanity.
p1493
aVin the past year, israel has hosted so many world leaders, and i had the honor of representing my country on six different continents.
p1494
aVone year, six continents.
p1495
aVi went to africa, where i saw israeli innovators increasing crop yields, turning air into water, fighting aids.
p1496
aVi went to asia, where we deepened our relations with china and with singapore and expanded our cooperation with our muslim friends in azerbaijan and kazakhstan.
p1497
aVi went to europe, where in london and paris, saloniki and budapest, we enhanced our security and economic ties.
p1498
aVi went to australia, becoming the first israeli prime minister to visit our great allies down under, and just last week, i went to south america, visiting argentina and colombia, and then i went on to mexico, becoming, if you can believe it, the first israeli prime minister ever to visit latin america.
p1499
aVafter 70 years, the world is embracing israel, and israel is embracing the world.
p1500
aVone year, six continents.
p1501
aVnow, it's true: i haven't yet visited antarctica, but one day, i hope to go there.
p1502
aVi want to go there, too, because i heard that penguins are also enthusiastic supporters of israel.
p1503
aVnow, you laugh, but penguins have no difficulty recognizing that some things are black and white, are right and wrong, and unfortunately, when it comes to un decisions about israel, that simple recognition is too often absent.
p1504
aVit was absent last december when the security council passed an anti-israel resolution that set back the cause of peace.
p1505
aVit was absent last may when the world health organization adopted - you have to listen to this - the world health organization adopted a syrian-sponsored resolution that criticized israel for health conditions on the golan heights.
p1506
aVas the great john mcenroe would say, you cannot be serious.
p1507
aVi mean, this is preposterous.
p1508
aVsyria has barrel-bombed, starved, gassed and murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens and wounded millions more, while israel has provided life-saving medical care to thousands of syrian victims of that very same carnage.
p1509
aVyet who does the world health organization?
p1510
aVisrael.
p1511
aVso is there no limit to the un's absurdities when it comes to israel?
p1512
aVwell, apparently not.
p1513
aVbecause in july, unesco declared the tomb of the patriarchs in hebron a palestinian world heritage site.
p1514
aVthat's worse than fake news; that's fake history.
p1515
aVmind you, it's true that abraham, the father of both ishmael and isaac, is buried there, but so, too, are isaac, jacob, sarah, rebecca - sarah's a jewish name, by the way - sarah, rebecca and leah, who just happened to be patriarchs and matriarchs of the jewish people.
p1516
aVwell, you won't read about that in the latest unesco report, but if you want to, you can read about it in a somewhat weightier publication.
p1517
aVit's called "the bible."
p1518
aVi highly recommend it.
p1519
aVi hear it even got four and a half out of five stars on amazon.
p1520
aVand it's a great read.
p1521
aVi read it every week.
p1522
aVladies and gentlemen, a moment to be serious.
p1523
aVdespite the absurdities, despite the repetition of these farcical events, there is change, slowly but surely.
p1524
aVthere are signs of positive change, even at the united nations.
p1525
aVmr. secretary-general, i very much appreciate your statement that denying israel's right to exist is anti-semitism, pure and simple.
p1526
aVnow that's important because for too long, the epicenter of global anti-semitism has been right here at the un, and while it may take many years, i'm absolutely confident that the revolution in israel's ties with individual nations will ultimately be reflected here in this hall of nations.
p1527
aVi say that because there's also a marked change in the positions of some of our key friends.
p1528
aVthanks to president trump's unequivocal support for israel in this body, that positive change is gathering force.
p1529
aVso thank you, president trump.
p1530
aVthank you for supporting israel at the un, and thank you for your support, ambassador nikki haley.
p1531
aVthank you for speaking the truth about israel.
p1532
aVbut ladies and gentlemen, here at the un, we must also speak the truth about iran, as president trump did so powerfully this morning.
p1533
aVnow, as you know, i've been ambassador to the un, and i'm a long-serving israeli prime minister, so i've listened to countless speeches in this hall, but i can say this: none were bolder, none were more courageous and forthright than the one delivered by president trump today.
p1534
aVpresident trump rightly called the nuclear deal with iran - he called it "an embarrassment."
p1535
aVwell, i couldn't agree with him more.
p1536
aVand here's why: iran vows to destroy my country.
p1537
aVevery day, including by its chief of staff the other day.
p1538
aViran is conducting a campaign of conquest across the middle east, and iran is developing ballistic missiles to threaten the entire world.
p1539
aVtwo years ago, i stood here and explained why the iranian nuclear deal not only doesn't block iran's path to the bomb, but actually paves it.
p1540
aVbecause the restrictions placed on iran's nuclear program have what's called "a sunset clause."
p1541
aVnow let me explain what that term means.
p1542
aVit means that in a few years, those restrictions will be automatically removed, not by a change in iran's behavior, not by a lessening of its terror or its aggression: they'll just be removed by a mere change in the calendar.
p1543
aVand i warned that when that sunset comes, a dark shadow will be cast over the entire middle east and the world because iran will then be free to enrich uranium on an industrial scale, placing it on the threshold of a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons.
p1544
aVthat's why i said two years ago that the greater danger is not that iran will rush to a single bomb by breaking the deal, but that iran will be able to build many bombs by keeping the deal.
p1545
aVnow, in the last few months, we've all seen how dangerous even a few nuclear weapons can be in the hands of a small rogue regime.
p1546
aVnow imagine the danger of hundreds of nuclear weapons in the hands of a vast iranian-islamist empire with the missiles to deliver them anywhere on earth.
p1547
aVi know there are those who still defend the dangerous deal with iran, arguing that it will block iran's path to the bomb.
p1548
aVladies and gentlemen, that's exactly what they said about the nuclear deal with north korea, and we all know how that turned out.
p1549
aVunfortunately, if nothing changes, this deal will turn out exactly the same way.
p1550
aVthat's why israel's policy regarding the nuclear deal with iran is very simple: change it or cancel it.
p1551
aVfix it or nix it.
p1552
aVnixing the deal means restoring massive pressure on iran, including crippling sanctions until iran fully dismantles its nuclear weapons capability.
p1553
aVfixing the deal requires many things, among them inspecting military and any other site that is a suspect, and penalizing iran for every violation.
p1554
aVbut above all, fixing the deal means getting rid of the sunset clause.
p1555
aVand beyond fixing this bad deal, we must also stop iran's development of ballistic missiles and roll back its growing aggression in the region.
p1556
aVi remember when we had these debates.
p1557
aVas you know, i took a fairly active role in them - and many supporters of the deal naively believed that it would somehow moderate iran.
p1558
aVit would make it a responsible member, so they said, of the international community.
p1559
aVwell, you know, i strongly disagreed.
p1560
aVi warned that when the sanctions on iran would be removed, iran would behave like a hungry tiger unleashed, not joining the community of nations, but devouring nations one after the other.
p1561
aVand that's precisely what iran is doing today.
p1562
aVfrom the caspian sea to the mediterranean, from tehran to tartus, an iranian curtain is descending across the middle east.
p1563
aViran spreads this curtain of tyranny and terror over iraq, syria, lebanon and elsewhere, and it pledges to extinguish the light of israel.
p1564
aVtoday, i have a simple message to ayatollah khamenei, the dictator of iran: the light of israel will never be extinguished.
p1565
aVnetzach israel lo yeshaker.
p1566
aVthose who threaten us with annihilation put themselves in mortal peril.
p1567
aVisrael will defend itself with the full force of our arms and the full power of our convictions.
p1568
aVwe will act to prevent iran from establishing permanent military bases in syria for its air, sea and ground forces.
p1569
aVwe will act to prevent iran from producing deadly weapons in syria or in lebanon for use against us.
p1570
aVand we will act to prevent iran from opening new terror fronts against israel along our northern border.
p1571
aVas long as iran's regime seeks the destruction of israel, iran will face no fiercer enemy than israel.
p1572
aVbut i also have a message today for the people of iran: you are not our enemy.
p1573
aVyou are our friends.
p1574
aV(farsi: shoma duste ma hesteed.)
p1575
aVone day, my iranian friends, you will be free from the evil regime that terrorizes you, hangs gays, jails journalists, tortures political prisoners and shoots innocent women like neda soltan, leaving her choking on her own blood on the streets of tehran.
p1576
aVi have not forgotten neda.
p1577
aVi'm sure you haven't, too.
p1578
aVand so, the people of iran, when your day of liberation finally comes, the friendship between our two ancient peoples will surely flourish once again.
p1579
aVladies and gentlemen, israel knows that in confronting the iranian regime, we are not alone.
p1580
aVwe stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those in the arab world who share our hopes for a brighter future.
p1581
aVwe've made peace with jordan and egypt, whose courageous president, abdel-fattah al-sissi i met here last night.
p1582
aVi appreciate president al-sissi's support for peace, and i hope to work closely with him and other leaders in the region to advance peace.
p1583
aVisrael is committed to achieving peace with all our arab neighbors, including the palestinians.
p1584
aVyesterday, president trump and i discussed this, all of this, at great length.
p1585
aVi appreciate president trump's leadership, his commitment to stand by israel's side, his commitment to advance a peaceful future for all.
p1586
aVtogether, we can seize the opportunities for peace, and together we can confront the great dangers of iran.
p1587
aVthe remarkable alliance between the united states and israel has never been stronger, never been deeper.
p1588
aVand israel is deeply grateful for the support of the trump administration, the american congress and the american people.
p1589
aVladies and gentlemen, in this year of historic visits and historic anniversaries, israel has so much to be grateful for.
p1590
aVone hundred and twenty years ago, theodore herzl convened the first zionist congress to transform our tragic past into a brilliant future by establishing the jewish state.
p1591
aVone hundred years ago, the balfour declaration advanced herzl's vision by recognizing the right of the jewish people to a national home in our ancestral homeland.
p1592
aVseventy years ago, the united nations further advanced that vision by adopting a resolution supporting the establishment of a jewish state.
p1593
aVand 50 years ago, we reunited our eternal capital, jerusalem, achieving a miraculous victory against those who sought to destroy our state.
p1594
aVtheodore herzl was our modern moses, and his dream has come true.
p1595
aVwe've returned to the promised land, revived our language, ingathered our exiles, and build a modern, thriving democracy.
p1596
aVtomorrow evening, jews around the world will celebrate rosh hashanah, the beginning of our new year.
p1597
aVit's a time of reflection, and we look back with wonder at the remarkable, the miraculous rebirth of our nation, and we look ahead with pride to the remarkable contributions israel will continue to make to all nations.
p1598
aVyou look around you, and you will see these contributions every day.
p1599
aVin the food you eat, the water you drink, the medicines you take, the cars you drive, the cell phones you use, and in so many other ways that are transforming our world.
p1600
aVyou see it in the smile of an african mother in a remote village who, thanks to an israeli innovation, no longer must walk eight hours a day to bring water to her children.
p1601
aVyou see it in the eyes of an arab child who was flown to israel to undergo a life-saving heart operation.
p1602
aVand you see it in the faces of the people in earthquake-stricken haiti and nepal who were rescued from the rubble and given new life by israeli doctors.
p1603
aVas the prophet isaiah said, (says in hebrew first) "i've made you alight onto the nations, bringing salvation to the ends of the earth."
p1604
aVtoday, 27 hundred years after isaiah spoke those prophetic words, israel is becoming a rising power among the nations, and at long last, its light is shining across the continents, bringing hope and salvation to the ends of the earth.
p1605
aVhappy new year.
p1606
aVshanah tovah from israel.
p1607
aVthank you.
p1608
a.
